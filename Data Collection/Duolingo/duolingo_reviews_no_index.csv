"I would've gave this learning app 5 stars review if it not making me keep repeating courses that I've done before everytime there was a big update. As a learning app, this app is wonderful, the courses are gradually level up in the nice pace. But everytime there is a big update of the courses, my completed ""legendary"" level of the courses are gone, I've to re-do almost everything again, and it happened 3times already, it's frustrating. And if it happen again, then I would've quit this app."
"Been using this app for more than 30 days, i was really enjoy it, this app helps me to improve my chinese. However since they changed the sequence of hanzi, it has become harder to learn and practice lessons. The words are no longer linked, makes it difficult to focus on learning new words and sentences at one time. Hopefully the team listen and aware about this impact and restore the structure to prev version :)"
"Great UI, but very slow paced learning. This is a bad alternative to learning any languages, compared with 1. Books 2. Video lessons 3. Live courses 4. Flashcards The selection of words from their ""keyboard"" honestly makes it look more like a jigsaw puzzle than what could've been a great source to train spelling abilities (such as Japanese, Chinese, and Korean characters). I do understand that a lot of sentences can be expressed in many different ways, though, so this isn't quite a major issue."

"So far so good, on a free plan but will consider a subscription Edit, just had a notification to upgrade, actually the price is OK, but there is no option to pay monthly, all in one go 12 months up front, the problem with that is somewhere like Indonesia that is a lot of money up front that very few can afford, making the payment monthly is much fairer and would I believe result in more people signing up."
"The app is pretty good, there's lots of lessons to take (sometimes a bit too much), the ads are a bit inconsistent (30 seconds ad exist), and the app sometimes freeze for no reason and I even got a notification that says the app is not responding even though I'm still using it (unstable app) EDIT: There's quite a lot of LGBT references in the app (on japanese at least) so it sometimes feels a bit awkward when learning. I find it weird that these things are forced on the learners, no warning..."
"The timed game only gives 90 seconds to answer several lengthy questions, and that's ridiculous. Finding the randomly assorted words in long sentences took quite some time, especially since I'm only a beginner. This caused the timer to run out, and I had to choose between buying a timer boost or starting over. Honestly, this challenge didn't seem to contribute to improvement but only added stress and fried my brains"
"It's pretty good if you're learning one of the popular languages (english, spanish, french, etc). But the other ones (danish, swedish, indonesian, finish, etc) are completely abandoned, with the same content as back when the courses were created by the community - except that they removed the grammar explanations. The social part and gamification are really good, but this neglect of some of the couses are very demotivating."
"I like the way that it still brings up words in old lessons so in that way, you could never forget about them. Overall a great app but i do come across this bug very often--- Currently, the words and sentences do not make a sound. I can't hear any words but i can hear other noises like the noise when i get a question right; as a person who very much relies on hearing to understand, it makes it so much more difficult."
"I'm having an issue the last 3 days. It is not accepting speaking exercises consistently. It almost seems to lag. I'm having to do them multiple times and sometimes it fails out. I have updated the app and restarted my phone. I tested it with Bluetooth headphones. It does not appear to be an issue with my phone. I had my boyfriend try doing exercises too, and he has the same result on my device. His is fine. I'm having to use freezes to preserve my streak."
"I have learned a lot. The constant changes has set my learning back but I have been able to adjust to the latest update better than the first big change. When the change is too big, I usually start over because then I'm faced with words that I haven't been taught. The reason for the 4* is that now on the Android version they have this exercise where they say a word, give you two spellings to choose from and they don't tell me what the word means. I miss the math & music from the apple version."
"Great app, makes learning super fun and easy. Definitely makes learning a language 1000% better when used side by side with a real curriculum. That being said, it sucks that it doesn't qualify as a language credit. Also, I really wish there was an option to set a few days of the week for a break. Having to still do lessons when you're sick/working/on the weekend kind of sucks. If there were an option to pick a couple of days off that would be awesome."
"Okay first off, love everything about this app. The accessibility, the art, the memes. BUT one thing I would want changed is how long the units are. Sometimes I'll finish a unit then not have everything engrained in my brain and it's frustrating because I can't focus on the next one. It also demotivates me to do lessons because I can't focus. So basically that's the only thing I would want changed. Great app overall though! <3"
"A great ""free"" way to learn or brush up on a language. The ads are not too disruptive, but with very few mistakes you are forced to buy back in or delay your lesson; a more generous algorithm might be more conducive to encourage usage and learning...but then I guess they would like you to buy in for unlimited play. It's probably worth it if you can skip lessons as it sometimes feels it progresses slowly. I recommend playing without noise or distractions to prevent mistakes."
"If I could I would rate a 3.5, this app is really great! But if you don't have the super learner subscription you only get a certain amount of hearts (how many mistakes you can make) and if you have a certain amount of mistakes you can't use the app until the next day. The lessons for the alphabets are really good! but during normal lessons, it will give me a random word that has never popped up and I have to click the right translation, which I always get wrong because it never seen it."
"My opinion of the app has been dropping a lot lately. Removing the sentence discussions has been a huge loss. I made heavy use of those to understand mistakes or sentences I didn't quite get. Now, many mistakes. Leave you confused and with no explanation or way to figure out what you did wrong. Overall, duolingo is not a bad app for supplementing language learning. However, it falters as a primary source and it seems to be getting worse and not better."
"I love Duo, the only problem is that as they update the app, they add things into the earlier levels. In theory, this is great, except if you're already past that point you don't get a chance to learn it. And then, when you get review questions about it, you have no clue despite supposedly having learnt it before. It would be great if they'd add in a section to review newly added things in earlier levels! As it is, it's quite frustrating. I paused a lesson to make this review because of this!"
"Duolingo is a fantastic way to learn Spanish, by having you practice all the ways you will be engaging with it...listening, speaking, reading, & writing. By giving some answers to choose from, you have higher success as you build your knowledge, then when you have gotten to practice a word, phrase, or sentence structure, it will have a ""fill in the blank"" and check your memory. Just the right balance between encouraging & challenging your knowledge. And you immediately see the correct answer."
"The app is easy to use and interactive, but the units are LONG and the amount of repetition (repeating the same thing a MILLION times) makes this app extremely BORING!! I may have repeated the same word at LEAST 60 times. The repetition discourages me to focus, learn and memorize but instead encourages me to just try to finish the lesson as fast as possible. Unless they fix these issues I would NOT recommend this app to first time users."
"Take away the hearts. The app makes it more about hearts than the learning experience. The lives force you to focus on making little to no mistakes. People shouldn't get dinged for making mistakes when thats how you learn. The leader board sucks too. Take it away. The app becomes more about competition/ getting 1st place than learning. The refresher courses dont make sense. It seems that they are too basic even when you are far past that. I don't want to learn ""agua"" again when I'm past that."
"An amazing app;it really is. The animation is good and the voice is also not bad and the lessons are really good. My two stars are held because the leaderboard doesn't help, especially in the diamond league,gaining thousands of XPs and not knowing a thing;we are here to learn not to compete. Being demoted while learning more is really really discouraging. I hope the changes are made, thanks Duo."
"I'm happy to be learning a new language. The thing with Duolingo, though, for better or worse, is it's a competition with others. I understand that it's designed to keep you coming back, and it does, but the problem that presents is faulty scoring resulting in not being awarded points you earned, thus making the game-like aspect of it pointless and frustrating. I've written to them repeatedly regarding not receiving the 15 minute double points, but they do not respond. Terrible customer service."
"Gamification of learning isn't very helpful... less about the learning and too much emphasis on getting points. Each ""improvement"" reduces its value as a learning tool. Was once a great app... the decline accelerated with the structure changes. You totally lost track of what you had done and where you were up to. At least users could have been given the option of the long-standing pathway or choosing the strange new path. Poor pedagogy seems to be entrenched."
"It's really good and genuinely helped with my learning. 🙂 Having goals and trying to keep up a streak makes you more determined to practice everyday. ( But like I actually feel so guilty when I don't complete a lesson and it keeps sending me notifications about it 😁) It has a lot of languages as well, and the only adds are for super Duolingo, 🦜 which is like the premium version. I would highly recommend, you've got nothing to lose ( except storage space 😔)"
"Overall a great app. However, over the last month (February 2024), there has been many instances where the app does not sync, and your lessons don't get counted. It has been very annoying, and if you aren't lucky and have a streak freeze ready, then your constantly wasting your jems just trying to keep your streak afloat. Before this became an issue I would have given 5 stars."
"First off, I find Duolingo is excellent for learning a language. The native speakers are genuine (I'm bilingual so I can tell) and the advanced levels are really well done. Although the repetition may be annoying, it gets those phrases into your long term memory. But the 'game' is glitchy. Many times my 'double points' have just disappeared. Other times it won't let me into certain areas or forgets what I just did. And no it's not my WiFi."
"I adore Duolingo and pay for Super, but a month ago I ran into a level that had a bug which means it cannot be completed. I have submitted bug reports, flagged it, emailed support, and no one has got back to me. It's really interrupted my momentum because I can't progress unless I skip ahead (and I can't stand the idea of that!! haha). I would really like the problem to be fixed, but more importantly it would be nice if someone from the massive empire that is Duolingo actually responded."
"I absolutely love Duolingo! It's such a great way to learn a bit everyday in bitesize pieces. However, I'm having trouble turning private mode of as it still thinks I'm under the age of 13. I also think that it would be nice if their was a feature to explain grammar and how it usually works as while it's easy to spot simple patterns, there are some areas which are more confusing."
"There's a lot of free lessons to be had, before the whole ecosystem of full screen ads and nagging you to pay for hearts gets too annoying. There is way too much repetition of the same words, over and over. I know it's part of learning, but it's too much. Also a bug/feature that keeps reseting progress backwards, so you have to go though the whole repetition of the same few words over again and again. I was on unit 12. Went back to 10, then 9, and now it's on 7?! Not good!"
"The quality of translations has gone way down since getting rid of most human translators and turning it over to AI. I can't tell you the number of times it's said a correct answer was wrong, and I send flags each time. For example, ""niña"" & ""chica"" both mean girl, so it isn't *wrong* to use one over the other. I've also had times their translation was flat out wrong. That's not to mention the number of times the mic doesn't pic up speech, or the times it crashes/freezes up."
"The countdown on the rapid lessons is rediculous! I can't possibly type that fast, as well as it being a language that isn't native to my keyboard so typos and corrections occur. Yet the timer keeps ticking :( other than that I'm loving it so far, besides the excess of ads, that is. Which I suppose is to be expected. However, if the price were a bit more reasonable I would have no bothers paying for super, even if just to remove the ads, which I imagine will drive me away relatively soon."
"Excellent app overall. Four things: - great for vocabulary and pronunciation but not for grammar, as there are no explanation why I get it wrong (languages have rules, if they're not explained, you learn by repetition, with no understanding of the language structure) - the quality of the recordings is sub-standard which can make listening a challenge, even with headphones. - Some of the teachings are incorrect - some adverts lag and force me to close the app and reopen it."
"Not a bad service, good motivation for language-learning, IN GENERAL really good. When I do a timed lesson, if the lesson times out before I finish, the app freezes on a grayed out screen. I have to close the app and restart it. This is really frustrating. Sometimes, when I'm really motivated to continue, I open the wrong app accidentally. Please fix this."
"Resuming: the best app to learn languages. Just two things: first, let's keep avoiding ads and talking about ""becoming pro"". And second, instead of making too many lessons on the same content, it would be best if having, let's say, around five or six lessons for each content, and teach new words a bit faster, and, to be systematic, add whole ""review"" units across courses. Of course, with less lessons, let's say, around three, four, or maybe, even five. But not so many. Speak to type not working."
"Fun and easy interface, but unfortunately, it focuses mostly on parroting phrases rather than teaching and explaining the mechanics of the language. No explanations if you're confused about how or why certain words are used. No explanations of grammer and tenses and such. As such, you'll learn to say things, but you won't very easily learn how to build and independently use the language. It's fun, but if you're really serious about learning a language well and quickly, there are better options."
"Good but some futures are limiting, like the hearts as it just makes it harder to learn if you punish mistakes. Also the demotion zone upsets people if they lose something they worked hard for. Imagine losing something like that that you even worked on holidays for, when you are ill, when you've had no sleep, it's just too much sometimes. It is an amazing app though if you want to learn new languages with lots of different techniques to help. I like all the characters too."
"(Spanish Course) does a great job of teaching a language by breaking it down into smaller sections to work on. a few downsides. 1) after a few chapters the app tends to crash often and doesn't load the animations. 2) it tends to freeze in the middle of a lesson but an easy fix for it is long press the icon, app info, force stop. 3) the lessons teach you new words and conjugation for them, but then later goes in depth about patterns to look for. overall a good app, I plan to keep using it."
I have been using duolingo for over several years. The app is one of the best for learning languages. But it is missing a very crucial feature. The ability to reset an entire unit or one of the circles inside a unit. If you are far into the curriculum you often forget which units/circles you need repeat because you haven't learned or undertsood them or just for revision. I'm sure many other people would find this feature helpful. Kudos to you for this free and fun language learning app. 👏
The paid version is obviously so much better. It's hard to progress in the free version with all the ads. I think the only thing that would make the paid version better would be if they added some mini games with little quests or something. Or conversation where you have to speak stuff back to practice formulating responses and not just saying random sentences. It's a great app and very helpful.
"I've been using the app for 2 years. The paid version, Super Duolingo, is far worse than the free product. It doesn't make any sense to design pay-to-win features in an app that is supposed to be educational. Because if you pay to win a language test you're literally paying not to learn. On top of this basic flaw, the system running the ads is very buggy, especially since the last update. The app will crash at least once a day when trying to run ads. The ads themselves are often for scam apps."
"Edit: I love the app and I pay for it. The reminders are not as passive aggressive anymore. Two big downsides: 1. Kanji, please teach them from the start! The seperate tab is way too slow and is not consistent with stroke order. 2. The sections and units keep shifting and changing in Japanese. It doesn't feel like I am making progress, because I get thrown back and forth between units with updates. The paths inside each unit are way too long, I get the hang of it in two lessons."
"Duolingo is making changes all the time which are - in my opinion - not improvements. I have been using the app for over a year, but after all these changes I am considering trying another language app. Some of these changes are: - removing the view for learners to see how far they are to the next achievement - removing predictive text from the Gboard keyboard (really?!) Duolingo was a lot of fun and I enjoyed doing a few lessons every day. Now not so much, it has become a chore..."
"I was completing gold star lessons, but after an update, the gold lessons randomly turned back into regular completed lessons, no gold star. About half the lessons in every unit in multiple sections reverted back. It's very frustrating as I was doing the gold stars all along from the beginning. I tried to contact support multiple times about it, but they never even responded. Otherwise, Duolingo is ok. I've tried other apps but always gravitate back here. The price is right, too."
"All the lessons were changed, and the lessons which were previously completed now have lots of new information in them. So after months of making steady progress, I can't effectively complete new lessons because the app thinks I know lots of words that were never taught. Update: Now they have the suggestion strip on the Android keyboard. With dexterity problems, this makes it very difficult and frustrating to type. Wish I could give 0 stars now!"
"Very good learning app. It has helped a lot. There are a few bugs where my answers were coded as wrong but the correction displayed the same answer I gave as correct. Also when there are more than one word for an item, I got it wrong when I used the first one learned even though they're the same meaning. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoy using this app!"
"I was having a great time, but I think Match Madness is terribly broken. It is impossible to get much past level 5 without buying time extensions or cheating (the match order is predictable!) You are then stuck getting 5-10xp and can't start over at level 1 unless it asks you. It's not fun, and doesn't help me learn. I'd also like to see a list of the words and phrases I have seen and be able to run though unit and section reviews. Edit: They added the ability to see a list of words, and a star"
"It used to be an amazing app, but since they removed the option to discuss sentences with other users, I've noticed that my learning pace has significantly slowed down. I gained so much insight from other people's explanations, and now it feels like I'm just memorizing sentences without truly understanding the grammar or vocabulary choices. Sometimes I try to look things up online, but it's frustrating compared to the convenience of having it just a click away like before."
"I've been using this app for a few years (Super Duo family plan) and overall it's a great way to learn. My only complaint is that in recent months, I've noticed that the daily quests screen is slow to update. I've almost lost my streak when a quick peek at that screen shows I've already gotten 30 XP that day, only for it to suddenly change to 0 XP several seconds later, right before my eyes - because it was initially showing yesterday's info. Sometimes I can't tell if I've done a lesson or not."
"Fantastic app. It's fun and addictive in the right ways, and has helped me get interested in learning again. However, the ads are a problem. I know the app needs ads to run, but I wear headphones (as the app recommends) to better hear the sounds, and then after each lesson has a VERY loud ad plays right in my ear, which is both annoying and hurts. Perhaps playing ads on half volume or mute as a default could be implemented?"
"It's a good language app and I feel that I'm making good progress. The speech/sound is clear and will understandable and the topics are useful. What is like to see if better tailoring to the users needs - maybe have some options to choose goals (e.g. vocabulary, pronunciation, grammar, etc). For example, the personalized practice keeps showing me from the same set of sentences from session to session, even when my answers are correct several times in a row."
"The app has been helpful in smoothing out my chosen language. However, the hearts system is horrible. It's discouraging at best. Especially if you're doing a longer session on the app in the higher tiers of the courses. Also, reviewing your mistakes is behind a paywall. Of all things to put behind a paywall in an education app, this should never be one. Loses a star for this alone."
"I enjoy learning a new language. Duolingo is easy to use. An improvement would be to only collect badges and not compete in the league. That's not motivating for me, grades aren't real but progress is measureable. Choosing your level of interest and proficiency goals would also be helpful. Is this available in the paying app? The app occasionally doesn't give me my progress when I get 100%, that's annoying.🤓 I don't want to compete with others learning a language. Progress only, please."
"The app is fun and effective. However, the leagues will stop your progress dead in it's tracks. I was doing great until I got caught up with winning the silly leagues, which forced me to resort to grinding tricks and completely killed my forward progress (and joy). My advice is to go to the website and turn off leagues by setting your profile as private. They should make it an option within the app. Once I did that, I started having and actually learning again."
"Absolutely fine as a free app and for learning the basics, but it's getting very frustrating, particularly since the redesign. This got rid of the grammar, so it's more like just learning sentences by rote rather than learning than the language. The personalised practice is a very poor replacement for being able to revise specific lessons. It seems to fixate on 10-15 ""weakest"" words and doesn't refresh and going back through the path is almost impossible. A shame, as it's otherwise very good."
"Im having such a good time on this app. It's both educational and fun. ( as someone who gets bored pretty easily, so this especially helps). It's also colourful and interactive. It helps you set goals for yourself and encourages you to keep going. Also, the adds aren't really a problem. They ( adds) usually come in after every level has been completed and it doesn't take away from the learning experience at all. 10/10 would recommend 😊"
"The comments section really helped a lot, it's a shame you removed it Also audio keeps missing from my lessons. It appears at times, and I hear the sounds of notification (right and wrong answers, lesson end), but I'd like to hear some pronunciation as well. All in all - fun app, encouraging you to continue your language studies, but be sure to use it alongside other materials"
"I like the app. However, when I play consistently, it becomes too demanding to complete all the daily tasks when the algorithm does not allow me to fulfill them all unless I complete so many lessons. I think this is unreasonable and discourages me from being interested in playing as much. It also makes the user experience less fun. I could skip a day, use a freeze, and reset the algorithm to set easier daily tasks. But this contrasts a true spree and creates gaps between lessons."
"I enjoy the challenges, different lesson styles. However, what Duolingo lacks is actual explanations of grammatical rules and sentence structure, for instance. The lesson overview is largely unhelpful and bare. If someone were to start a new concept/conjugation they should be able to learn about it and not just guess the correct answer based on context in hopes of getting it right. I think it would be helpful to include a ""why"" at the bottom after an incorrect answer is submitted if it applies."
"Lots of bugs in interface where messages doesn't allow user to progress, (no button or hidden) (message overlaying choices) only option to quit. Need to clean up the interface guys. I'm currently learning Japanese, the voices sound a little unnatural. The principles are good. The learning curve is good. Just frustrating when you hit a bug."
"The lessons start easy and become harder, building off what was previously learned. There is a lot of repetition to ensure that even if you happen to ""guess"" correctly the first time you actually learn the words and how to properly use them. The lessons center around a particular topic so you get that word repetition quickly, then move on to a different topic. There is a good mix of reading, listening and speaking to ensure you are learning all aspects of the language."
"You need to know American English. i.e. ""downtown"" and missing out ""of"" and ""that"" . They never accept Football, only soccer I dislike clicking to the next ""page"" and the audio starting in a nano second . i would prefer to click to start it. However; the whole site is put together spectacularly well and is a fabulous learning tool. It can be totally free, which is amazing. i have chosen to pay for ""super duo"". if you can afford it, it's worth every penny. Happy learning."
"You will learn another language eventually. The repetition is great for committing new concepts to memory. It could use more adjectives and synonyms to help you to establish a style of communicating, however. You're on your own there. You also won't learn much if you don't make sure to refrain from looking at the optional answers altogether until you've thought of the entire sentence on your own. It's necessarily too easy for the most part, unless you follow your own rules of navigation."
"Great app for learning language! it is very thorough and it goes over sentences over and over to make sure you remeber and understand them. the only issue is that when the ""five in a row!"" and similar screens pop up, on semi-old phones the animation is really laggy and will take around 2 seconds to get back to the lesson, sometimes making you unable to even see the ""five in a row"" animation and instead show a white screen for 2 seconds. overall though, great app! 😇"
"Its great so far, but then you get stuck with a burst of new terms, with really no way to practice them. When you have a paid service, there is a training area, but it does not allow you to choose the lession type you want to practice. such as all/current/last 3. A lot of the time I get stuck on the same exercise for the entire day. Also for some reason there is no addition of note cards to or a way to choose to make your own test. That said, great second or third tool to use to learn."
"Duolingo is an easy way to learn a new language. I think that this application could be improved by having personalised lessons to strengthen your weak parts in the language. Also, I think this app should have a 'What have you learnt?' challenge, where, at the end of each level, you answer the questions based on the level you have just finished. The language I am learning doesn't include speaking exercises or stories, which is a bit disappointing."
"I'll say this is a great app. You really learn a lot if you think about the patterns you are noticing and don't just memorize.It's a very engaging app. The big issue for me was a glitch with the voice recognition. There are voice lessons where you need to speak into your phone. Duolingo just won't recognize anything. Even if you're screaming into the phone. These glitches aren't frequent, and lucky doesn't impact your lesson progress. But it is infuriating."
"The quests system is very bugged. Sometimes I will complete a daily quest, but I won't get the reward nor a point towards completion for the goals for the month. Sometimes it will randomly update later in the day, but usually not. This has been an issue for months. For some reason I also need to meet 50 quests a month, whereas my friends only need 30. Not sure if its because my XP is higher, but I feel like it should be the same for everyone. I do have Duolingo super, but I won't renew as of now"
"It's a great app for your kids of you want them to improve reading. Great app duolingo! Keep up the great work. Overall assessment: While Duolingo isn't a perfect app, it is one of the best ones out there for learning a language because it's flexible for both the casual, and the intensive, language learner. It is a fun way to get students to learn new languages and improve their vocabulary in a fun and interactive way. Overall I just love this app.I have no words but excellent fantastic app.⭐💫⚡"
"This has been a helpful tool for learning foreign language for me, and the experience has been mostly positive. Voice recognition leaves a lot to be desired. Sometimes it doesn't work on some words, other times it needs something pronounced incorrectly to work. The leagues system doesn't reward progress in languages as much as it should. To stay afloat against other users, there seems to be more benefit with spamming review lessons."
"This app really helps you learn a language, or if you already know a little of the language, you can practice more on what you already know. Btw, as a person with a busy life, the exp challenges that you do to rank up are really like if you have Super Duolingo, you're set to get the top three. I was racing somebody with super, and they got 200 exp in 10 minutes. I only got 30. It's pay to win."
They've suddenly become more interested in making money and making poor decisions. They greatly increased the event difficulty several magnitudes beyond what it was so it's no longer useful. I keep getting content in practice mode that I haven't even gone over yet. I often accidentally hit the can't listen now. I would like the ability to at least have to confirm or cancel that out. Maybe even move it somewhere else.
"After 85 days, I've removed some stars. My main issues: Sentences are oddly structured. I would never say or need half of the sentences taught, especially when traveling for a few weeks. Even the sentences in my native tongue are awkward and clunky. Their outlines before each section don't always help and often the lessons aren't related to them. Only bumped it from 2 to 3 stars because it can be used for free. I'll stick to Rosetta Stone where I've been able to use and retain more."
"I love Duolingo, but the app is glitchy and causes unnecessary frustration. For example, if you finish a lesson at midnight it clears all your daily goals with no chests to open, or on the ramp up XP challenge it will randomly make me start at the beginning, even though I made it with time left. I wish it had more options to keep me involved, love the matching game, but it isn't always available in Japanese or other languages. Also miss stories. Wish all languages had these options."
"Errors in lessons are no longer being corrected in a timely manner. I've reported a couple that I'm 100% certain are wrong, but they continue to show up. I'm not sure if it's months later, but definitely weeks later. It's still useful at this point, but if something looks questionable, don't assume it's right. Update: I've discovered that listening to the intonation in Duolingo is interfering with learning to speak correctly."
"I have a weak knowledge of Spanish, and have wanted to improve. I have completed just a few lessons so far, and they are great. I especially appreciate that the app can test speaking skills through use of the phone microphone. Weeks later: Overall still great. Sometimes seems to get ""stuck"" and will not open until I reboot my phone (Pixel 6, Android 14)."
"Decent. However I cannot give it 5 stars because of its lack of accessibility in crucial places. For example, I can just barely complete the matching exercises, because the app requires me to turn off my screen reader. Guess how useful that is to someone who can't see. , it's super frustrating, especially when I am made to repete the exercise for getting it wrong. I understand the app doesn’t understand how unhelpful that is, But if any of you devs out there see this, please, if you care at all"
"I think this app would be better if there was a more clear overview of what you are learning. The new path system leaves me feeling lost, especially since half the lessons in the current section dont have anything to do with the section. Not to mention the new ""course refresher"" lessons create a ton of friction when trying to come back from breaking a streak. Maybe if I devoted more time to Duo, but I was under the impression this was supposed to be incremental and that's what I liked."
"I've used Duolingo since 2013, lots of changes over the years but I have no major complaints. I've gained a decent grasp of three languages, two more in the works, all totally free and that's really cool. One thing I would REALLY like to see is an option during those basic prompts to say the translation of a sentence rather than having to search for the words and tap on them. It would save a bit of time, feel more natural, and give you more speech practice."
"So I came back to Duo after a year or 2 and yes I missed the app. However some things have changed. Before I could retake the legendary classes without paying gems but now I can't. Also, Duo just always happens to drop my connection after a class, especially once I get a 2x boost. I'd have to close and reopen the app just to take the next class and that's not optimal. Still though, great work guys! This is my favorite app for learning any language"
"It definitely is not the same as taking classes to learn a language, but it can help at the beginning. It has a ""repetition makes perfect"" approach. However, it really lacks emphasis on grammar rules. Also, it would be really beneficial if there was an option to choose between the Latin American and the Spanish accent on the Spanish course (mind it is a very widespread language) because now I am stuck with the former pronunciation and vocabulary when I'd rather learn the latter."
"Great app, not fond of the forced competitions. The leaderboards and reminders of my spot on the leaderboards makes me want to stop using it entirely. I wish that feature could be turned off. I'm learning for me, not for a scoreboard. I have been paying for premium and dont know if I will continue to. I'm glad it provides the knowledge it does for so many people though. (Edit as of 2024) I'm really happy to see the leader boards became more of an optional feature! 5 stars."
"I have been using Duolingo for Spanish since 2022. It was great and very easy to learn until the ads started showing up one day. Without the super subscription, it's just too hard to keep practicing for a long time. I was forced to take a subscription and it was really helpful. But over the last few months, I have been facing a lot of bugs and glitches that are making me furious The lessons don't register in the friend's quest and XP boost sometimes vanishes. I hope the team fixes it!"
"The progression is steady & feels easy. Mistakes are reviewed in the lesson and lessons are generated to help correct previous mistakes in the icon errors. New vocabulary is introduced in very small batches within the topic. I love the fact that we have Freezes, it helps especially if we have to travel or too ill to do any lesson to keep our streak. I really feel like I'm learning without effort, the free version is very good but the paying option has more options. I highly recommend Duolingo."
"It is an educational way to waste time but not for serious language learning. The biggest annoyances for me are the mistakes. It has the option to report them, but it is a waste of time as they never get fixed. It really is shocking how many grammatical errors I have found in the English translations of phrases. It tells me I am wrong and gives me a version of the sentence that is grammatically incorrect. Next time it pops up it's more of a quiz on what Duo thinks the answer is."
"Started out with it and it was fine, but after a while it got to a point where I just don't want to engage with the app anymore. It does have genuine language learning, which is why 2 stars instead of 1, but it feels like proper learning is devalued. Instead of understanding the language, I'm taught to memorize individual translations, and more emphasis than I'm happy with is placed on maintaining daily streaks and competing for rank. Will be seeking a more effective alternative going forward."
It's definitely not worth the $155+ annual subscription cost. I sincerely hope no one is paying that. It isn't even worth the 60% off rate. The app developers have gone mad. There are so many bugs. And ads are now after every single lesson and getting longer. It used to be one ad every 2-4 lessons. The new interface is awful and reset progress for tons of users. Also the quests do not update correctly and you'll frequently not get credit for completing them.
"It is nice to learn, but it has its cons. It keeps spamming me with super doulingo ads, and it says that I can get it for free, and one second later it asks me to buy it for what, 12 dollars? Also, it is laggy, and it has streak-saving problems. I did a lesson, and it tells me that I didn't, even though I did, leading to my streak being lost. I wish that you could add more widget themes and types. I sometimes enter the lesson, and when I use a more formal version of the word, WRONG! 👎"
I actually love the app and even wanted to upgrade to premium a month at a time as I can't really afford to drop $80 right now. Had a hard time finding where to do that without directly clicking an ad. Found a button that says renew subscription. I click it expecting a menu with payment options. Instead it automatically charges my account for $83 when I have never had that subscription before (not the whole year). How are they allowed to do that??
"I've tried some other language learning apps but Duolingo is definitely the best one so far, it's fun, interactive and easy to use. I mean, really easy, my 8 year old sister knows how to use it- it's AWESOME It would've been 5 stars but I've come across a little issue. Other language learning apps I've used have this thing where you must say the word out loud, into your microphone, and helps with pronunciation. Duo doesn't have that but I'd change my rating to 5 stars if it could be put in!!!!!"
"This review is for the paid service. The big warning I would give is that customer service for this app is non-existent - I've emailed questions about my subscription multiple times and no response, which is pretty poor considering how much it costs! Also, in the Italian course the content of the units seems to have suddenly changed and become far easier (going from complex tenses to colours, for example. I wouldn't have paid for a course that was so basic, so I feel like I've been cheated!"
"Longer I use this app the less I like it. My Japanese lessons progress has been rolled back so many times, and it's just frustrating to have really non-sensical sentences as examples. Over the years, they have removed more features than added. There used to be a community that helped to explain grammar and other questions, but they REMOVED IT. And with the news of layoffs and replacing their workers with AI... yeah, I don't feel comfortable supporting this app. The owl was cute, though."
"I like DuoLingo, but the free version is terribly limited. For example, you need the Super subscription to be able to review your mistakes and correct them, which is an important part of learning a language. Also, everything requires gems in the free version, again limiting your ability to learn any language consistently. The only way is forward without reviewing past lessons if you're low on gems. I'm glad they sometimes offer 2-week trials, but they've really gotta improve the free version."
"The graphics make language learning fun! However, since I have been doing 4 languages, in the words section, the app confuses German words with Spanish ones. Also, the audio is really glitchy, most times not able to be heard at all on the section matching the sounds with the print. The only option is to say I can't do listening right now....because I can't hear anything!!! This is a new segment, and I hope it gets improved soon."
"An app that seems great, when you're starting out and don't know any better. The farther you go, the worse you realize it is; lack of clear explanations, lack of context, sometimes using archaic or overly formal phrases that native speakers would never use. They used to have a comment section for each lesson, which would let you turn to the community for deeper answers, but now that's gone too. The app is essentially useless in its current state. I am moving on, and will not be looking back."
"This app uses sentences that wouldn't be used in everyday conversation. Ex. ""Can you go out tonight?"" "" No, I can't because my dog wants to go to the restaurant."" 🤨 They used to have a forum where you can communicate with other speakers about the structure of sentences, tenses, and much more. The more experienced speakers would help the beginners but they closed that permanently. The basics (Numbers, days of the week) pop up in matching games randomly instead of whole lessons."
"I was really enjoying the app until it decided to ""sync my progress with the new and improved Chinese course."" It now thinks I've learnt a lot of words and grammar that I've never seen before. I can only review lessons I've never seen before. It has wiped all my previous mistakes so I can't practice things I was struggling with. I can't do new lessons because I no longer have the correct foundation. There was no notification that it was going to do this. Really disappointed."
"Good app, but I can't see an option of a mini dictionary for words that have been learned in different sections. My problem is I get through a section but quickly forget them. Other than that, it's very useful. There was a flashcards section for some languages, and it's included in the photos of the app above - but I've not encountered it when learning the Ukrainian language."
"I love this app. It makes learning a new language so fun! I'd like some more detailed grammar related explanations though. Sometimes it's hard to understand why something is counted as an error, when nothing is ever explained. The only real issue I have with this app, is that it freezes pretty often, when I do more than just a few levels at once. Still love it though and the Owl widget is the cherry on top!"
"A few updates ago, they made everything work, then they updated it a few more times and trashed it. There are now too many problems to list (including on a new phone). In addition to app issues, the problems include a decline in actual course quality. I used to recommend Duo to everyone, but now I am embarrassed that I did and steer people away from it. At this point, I emphasise DO NOT pay for it. If you want to use it for some basics or to brush up, it's ok, but don't trust it fully."
"Such a great app. The metholody seems too repetitive at the beginning, but then you suddenly find yourself knowing the grammer and hundreds of words and understand why it was this way. Also, the game like structure motivates to come back regularly. If you don't have time to go to a physical course, no I'm correcting myself, even if you have time to go to a physical course, go for Duolingo instead."
"Lots of repetition, great way to learn a language. Everything explained really well. Several years later, the endless repetition is very boring, the English idioms are American ones, there are virtually no new words, no more instruction on grammar or tenses. A couple of weeks ago, despite practising every day, it said I'd skipped a day and used a streak freeze. In the last 24 hours, it started telling me I'm offline (I'm not), and returned me to day one! That's the last straw - I quit."
"Path system is an abomination. Used to be so much better. Arabic alphabet function is useless, makes you repeat the same letters for 100 times. Skipping is made overly complicated. Stories are way too rare. It's the best of the worst. But getting progressively worse. Developers should stop substituting their own ideas and ambitions with big data."
"I've only been doing it for a few days, but I have already found it incredibly enjoyable. I do think that (as a suggestion) that there could be better ways of remembering the hirigana. For example, in school, I was taught 'ka' as car off a cliff because it made it easier to remember. Just an idea. Overall, good app. Edit: It's really annoying! I did my lesson yesterday and the day before that and yet it used up a streak freeze, saying I hadn't done my lesson! Really frustrating! Please fix it!"
"User beware! I used it and tried the free trial of Super Duolingo. It definitely has advantages over the non-subscription base, like unlimited messups. It reminded me trial period would be over in 2 days, so I changed the subscription in app so it would cancel. Well, it didn't and in 2 days I was getting billed the $89 for a year subscription (no refunds). Not happen Apparently you have to cancel it in the Google Play Store. Overall, it's a decent app and it helped learn the language some."
"It was an amazing language app!! One can learn languages as long as they stay consistent with their progress and adapt them through the things they also have fun doing, like studying and listening to music with the language you want to learn, then after, search for the meanings of the lyrics. I hope there would also be additional languages by this year like Bengali, Thai and many more. Thank you!!"
"Duolingo is the perfect app to learn a language or to learn several languages. I really enjoy the logical progression through the lessons and the ability to review and re-review harder lessons. I deducted a star because the one aspect of the app I don't enjoy is the competitiveness. It is great you can interact with other users, but like any other app with a social component, you have the people who simply abuse it to the detriment of others and ruin the overall experience."
"It's a great app overall, but it would be nice to be able reference past lessons without having to complete them again. Plus the speaking parts can be a little glitchy - I sneezed during one and passed, and in another, I had my whole family say the word ""l'oeuf"" and none of us got it correct. I can't find a ""report problems"" feature, either."
"Considering this program is free, it is really excellent, a genuine example of something for nothing. For me, the only other program or software comparable would be Gmail. Duolingo is that useful. As an English teacher, I suggest this is very good for vocabulary building, basic grammar, so reading and to some extent listening. Speaking OK too, writing only from a higher level of knowledge."
"It's awesome how much you get for free with Duolingo. I personally have no problem with the number of ads in the free version. For my goals, I don't need to have unlimited hearts. The Duolingo team has changed things up several times, and there are things that I miss about previous iterations. For instance, now you are forced into a specific learning path sequence, which eliminates a lot of the ability to choose what to learn about. Even with that, I'm very happy with this app."
"Update 2024 please fix the random crashing during a lesson. Just crashes and won't restart. - The perfect app for learning and practicing written and reading skills in other languages. The user interface is excellent and intuitive, with friendly reminders to practice. I think the app and the Duolingo system has been done very well and I would consider going Pro if I were more disciplined about practicing! Highly recommended, I have done some lessons in a few languages and it is very consistent."
"I really enjoyed the app, but multiple times, they will go through and completely overhaul your course changing things around. They'll add words and phrases into previous units you've already completed saying that you've learned it, but you haven't. It's really frustrating. It kills any passion and momentum you have learning. Also, despite the pictures they show, I have never once gotten a speaking lesson."
"It's a solid learning tool. You're not going to become fluent in whichever language you're trying to learn. Learning Japanese on this app wasn't as good as I thought it would be. The kana learning needs work. It's great as a recognition tool, but it doesn't give you many options to write. The AI pronounciations, the lack of explanation of conjugations, and no virtual speaking practice as is done on the Spanish lessons, severely hinder anyone that is trying to learn any of the CJK languages."
"Why can I still not access the new music lessons that we were told about last year? I like your app and have used it for years to learn a language, but I was excited to try the music lessons. I've waited patiently, but they never show on my app. I've tried updating and googling solutions. Nothing has worked. I'm very disappointed that it's not accessible. I'd rate your app higher if I could access the music and math that I was told about months ago. This would be a '5' if not for this."
I really like this app. But it's annoying that comments have been disabled and you're not allowed to make more than five mistakes in the free version wich I know is supposed to be motivating but sometimes it's really frustrating. Making mistakes is a major part of learning and shouldn't stop one from doing so. Also you can only get the correct awnser with one sentence structure when there's multiple to use in real life. So I almost always have to guess what the app wants me to say.
"Duolingo is an excellent and fun way to practice and learn a language. It's sometimes repetitive, but that's a necessary part of the learning process, or you easily forget. At a free level, making silly or accidental mistakes can be really frustrating, ending your day's progress (no more credits), but you can still practice without advancing. I find the format mostly clear, useful and amusing. I'm improving my French, even after living in France for seven years. It's giving me a lot."
"I'm on a 1300+ day streak with Duolingo and what it's offered has been well put together in terms of lesson content. But the app itself is often so glitchy that it's unusable. Crashes frequently sometimes crashing my whole phone with it. Sometimes the keyboard won't come up, sometimes it won't go away. Has got worse recently to the point I'm on the verge of giving up. Such a shame."
"Easy to get a lesson or two in each day so you continually make progress. But when you make a mistake, the app isn't helpful in explaining why the mistake is a mistake. The app does too many multiple choice exercises and not enough writing and listening ones. It's a lot harder to recall words and write them on your own than it is to pick from multiple choice. I don't have multiple choice when I'm trying to talk to someone! Also why need listening exercises to learn how words are pronounced"
"Over the last several months, Duolingo's lesson structure has fallen off big time. I'm using this everyday over the last two years and more, and I still see the same sentences that I saw over a year ago, although I have done 100s of lessons since. No new learning material, it just says 'personalized practice' as the topic of every lesson, and it's basically just redundant words and sentences. What happened? Product team needs to wake up. ML models are good, but have some supervison please"
"Yeah... This is definitely the best language app out there. The response time of the app. The content. The gameification. The ability to enjoy practicing for a long time. The reuse of the same words for new sentences, so it's all familiar, but distinctly a new meaning! A+ on that point. The option to use the keyboard or tap words, to increase difficulty on yourself. Definitely the best language app out there. And I've tried nearly all the apps for the language I'm learning."
"I love the way of learning and encouragement on Duolingo, it's so easy! Just when you do it for some weeks, it's starting to get a bit boring, cause they use the same style of lessons, the same characters and it seems to be repeating over and over again. Guess that's when people start to drop out. Please, feel free to add some new styles and approaches, especially for the Super Duolingo version that you pay for. PLEASE!"
"I'm giving you 2 stars because while the app is good, you have a few glaring and outright annoying issues. 1. No patch notes. A little blurb that's says ""we changed"" is unacceptable when every program posts patch notes. 2. Moving me in the program when you update. Now, there are multiple words I don't know that I'm being questioned on and no way of checking. 3. When I turn off a setting, leave it off - pronunciation. I know what I clicked. I'll change the score if and when you address this."
I've paid for this app for two years. I've become more confident in speaking Spanish but it's a far from perfect means of learning. It seems to concentrate more on league tables and streaks and its use of the language is very inconsistent. Some of the voices are incomprehensible. It's now stopped working. All attempts to contact Duolingo have failed. They don't respond to any means of communication at all. I have only just renewed my subscription and feel I've been cheated.
"Duolingo has really gone downhill recently. Yesterday was just the latest of several incidents where I gained a significant number of xp points, only to find myself knocked back down to where I had been prior. I had 84 xp yesterday morning and earned another 80 last night for a total of 164xp. However, this morning, I was back down to 84xp. This is very disappointing, especially for a paid subscription. I see from the comments that I am not the only one experiencing this. Please fix this issue."
"I was learning chinese over 2 years ago and recently picked it back up with the app, the older version when I was learning had basic speaking exercises to help get you to use the correct tones which I really liked! I come back recently and find that feature is gone unless you pay for it, I was going to pay for it when I realised it was going to charge me more then I pay for netflix or any of my streaming services! I tried the free trial and I can't even access the speaking parts still!"
"Good language resource but the ads are constant and repetitive. It's clearly done on purpose to annoy you and force into buying premium. The whole app is set up that way, including punishing users for making mistakes with the heart system, which is ridiculous considering how difficult it can be to learn a new language. I'm starting to lose interest and will look elsewhere to learn."
"Although the grammar explanations are poor, the layout of the curriculum is not bad. I like the fact that you can study multiple languages at once. The daily reminders and encouragements also help me remember to do it everyday. I'm a casual learner with experience learning another language before, so my goal is to do 5 minutes a day and improve gradually. For people in a hurry or with a concrete goal, the paid version that gives you more control over reviewing mistakes might be a good investment"
"(please read to the end developers). This has to be the best language app. I've had a very good learning experience using this app. My favorite aspect is the friend quests, I'm always excited to complete them and they really help me progress. Although I wish a feature where we learners can chat with and practice using texts with those on our friend list could be added. Thanks for a great app.😊"
"Horrible Changes! This was a great app and I have been using it for over a year. The latest update has taken a lot of the fun out of it. I don't enjoy it anymore & most days i don't even want to open the app. The new layout is unfriendly an makes it seem like a chore. New update: Constant app lags. Does not register my data at the cost of falling behind in leagues and having to pay diamonds for streak freezes even when I am active! Happens frequently! Many unnecessary changes, all for the worse."
"This is a great app, as I have said before. But I feel like there is an issue that is small bit, which makes me lose my motivation to do my lessons. This is the fact of the leaderboards. These were really fun until lots of people got duolingo Plus. Now it's almost impossible to get anywhere in higher leagues, and you constantly move down if you don't have duo plus. A simple solution would be to create 2 leagues. One for people with duo plus and another for those who don't have it."
"A good app, but I have concerns about the direction of the program. Duolingo has removed its best features. I can no longer ask other people about a weird phrase and know why I was wrong. I can no longer go out to Duo's language events. I can no longer expect updates for small languages or expect any new courses. My best most immersive language learning experiences via this app (and accompanying website) are now impossible. Now Duolingo is the same as every other app. For beginners only."
"Cool app if you want to repeat sentences instead of learning the actual rules of a language. I feel like the curriculum should include the rules of the language as it goes on, but the only help it offers is a small button in the corner with maybe 3 examples. May or may not even be what you're looking for. Repeating the same 5 sentences every day is causing problems in my progress with this app, and I only open it to do a practice lesson for my streak."
"They removed profile photos, with no options to change them to anything but a Mii. Also, the Spanish audio is horribly synthetic and hard to understand at times, yet the Polish is almost flawless. I don't understand. Also constantly begs you to sign up for the subscription after every lesson, as if ads aren't enough already. Used to use an old version of the app, until they forced the changes to update."
"Great app for learning, intuitive and user-friendly too. You guys are the best, really. I do have a problem though, when I started out, XP lightning challenge used to be available for Spanish (for my account) during the week but all of a sudden it got changed to Match madness. I enjoy the former challenge better for certain reasons and I don't know if there's a way to revert/undo the change. I've had to start learning a different language because of this change. I wish it could be changed."
"The basic idea initially seemed very promising, could have been perfect. But regrettably the infinite patience of the machine is driven to an extreme, resulting in an incredibly slow learning pace. The same handful of sentences are repeated over and over with very little, if any, new material introduced. As if the over all goal is too keep the learner stuck with the application as long as possible. That was really not what I expected when I enrolled."
"I get that it costs money to keep the app running but they excessively keep advertising the super version, which is annoying because in order to do most of the activities that give you more XP you need to pay for the super version. It's like rubbing it in your face that you could be rid of the annoying limitations on mistakes and needing gems for everything. I'm definitely not gonna pay for the super version if you keep reminding me of it after every lesson."
"Still 'syncing my work'. If this is an attempt to force me to upgrade to the paid version, its not working but it's getting ridiculous. 25.2.24 - I don't know what happened but I can't progress at all in the last three weeks. I keep getting a message that Duolingo synced my progress to a new and improved content, however I'm repeating the same lessons over and over because it won't stop 'sync' my work. I've been using Duolingo for over 2.5 years and have never been more frustrated with the app."
"Duolingo free version is not a good experience. However, getting the paid version (discounted) was a pretty good deal. I use this in combination with Mango Languages through my local library, which has been the best experience I've found after trying other apps over the years. Duo has a few things that bug me, but overall I think it does pretty well with content, accuracy, and accessibility approaching a new language. It's a pretty good value for something I use every day."
"Not impressed. There's a lot of repetition, which is good, but it will randomly throw in new words and expect you to know them. It will also speak the words w/o seeing how they are spelled and have you try to match them to the English translation through multiple choice. At that point it becomes a guessing game and frustrating. There's also no explaination on how sentences, words or sounds are formed in the language you're learning. Not sure how anyone can learn a new language from this."
"There's quite a bit I didn't love about this app, but didn't break the experience for me. What DID break it was the recent update that totally messed up the order and content of the lessons. Like other users, I now have many words that I'm supposed to have learnt, but didn't. Didn't find it worth the price before this (AI, no grammar support etc), and recent changes only solidify this."
"After all, Duolingo is a great app for people who want to learn languages for free. It was good at start but when I decided to also do it on my computer then the phone app wouldn't open but overall it was a good language app. I also get lowered down leagues which then pressurises me and I'm in a high league that I don't want to get lowered so there should be a leave option for it."
"I like it. I find it hard to learn things a lot of the time, but the way they teach is easy and understandable for me. I do hate that Im not able to make more than 4 mistakes without getting super though. And the personalized practice stuff bieng limited to super is also frustrating, but I understand they need to make money somehow. if you want to learn a language, I think this is a good start."
"So, I'm learning Korean. Duolingo is alright but I think its more useful with vocabulary. When it comes to the listening, sometimes there is nothing to hear and of course the answer given is automatically wrong since you don't hear anything. I like the idea of the leagues but at the same time, I don't. It almost seems to take away from the purpose of learning and makes it a priority to be in competition with others instead of learning. Overall, good app but I like the old version better."
Edited: I have been using this for over 700 days (French) and there a few things I would love to change. I wish it was more consistent. Sometimes it allows for typos but not consistently. And it's very repetitive. I know that's how you learn but 10+ of the same lesson gets old. I also really wish you could choose the subjects. I don't want to discuss social issues or news related things. I use this app to use my brain to learn but also to get a break from normal life.
"Good but very repetitive, there could have been a lot more vocabulary learned. There isn't much variation between lesson styles. Also the way hearts refresh takes a long time and unless you are a paying member, the gem cost is very high and not many ways of gaining them in order to complete the extra levels. Over all seems good, would like the option for European Portuguese."
"i like it. It's a bit of a pain sometimes to repeat the same lesson 5 times in a row. I would much rather have something that sees you struggling, and repeat the lesson, or sees you getting perfect lessons, and letting you go. Instead of fixed N° of similar lessons. That said super is a must! they had an excellent deal for new commers I do not regret 1 single bit this"
"The app is helpful to start a language, but it's soo full bugs. The rewards system gets mixups all the time and after a while it's really demotivating. Like in every hour you could watch a short ad and get some credit, but most of the time the icon for it just doesn't appear, or you don't get the coins. Also, the quests are often miscounted, the rewards you would get every 100day just dont happen, so its really annoying. Also, the level of the lessons doesn't always match the level I'm at."
"The newest update seems to have fixed my previous problem with slowness, but now the animations won't move (I've checked the animations setting, but it's on), and it's constantly behaving like I'm in battery saver, but I'm at 100%. I see no battery saver setting in the profile. Please let me know if there is a setting to get me out battery saver mode."
"the application freezes quite often, some voices are incomprehensible at times (they speak very fast), it has maintenance breaks right when one is given a time boost, which is not too often, and one has to compete with the upgraded version of Duolingo's users, leading to upheavals to even maintain a decent position within any league, but mostly within the Diamond one, given all the ads and the lower points one can accrue using the free version. As good as it gets! Thank you 😊 🙏🏻"
I have been a duolingo Super user for years. It was a great start; but the app was not helping me to progress in my language study. I want to cancel my subscription. It renewed 8 days ago. My first cancelation request was 3 days after renewal. Doesn't look like Duolingo wants to refund the money. Would have given them a better review before they tried to steal a year's subscription.
"Before any feedback, I highly recommend using this app as a training platform, it is very well done! A very good way to start getting the general idea of a new language. I think that the best language to learn on the platform is still English. The other languages tend to have less grammar material to access in the section workbook. Some exercises related to plurals become tricky and it's not clear why both of the phrases are not correct. Pronunciations are weird or inconsistent sometimes."
"They removed offline lessons, you can only do one lesson offline before you have to reconnect to the Internet. I'm going to keep using the app but I can't give this app a good review until they add back such a basic feature. They could make it a paid feature for all I care, just add it back. It's really disappointing to pay $80 for a year of premium just to find out they removed the premium feature I most excited for. Let us download courses!"
"The new interface ruined everything : the system was clear, the progression logical, so why decide to change everything? Everything is mixed up in every section, the ""lesson"" thing is basically useless as it only shows 1 or 2 basic sentences without explaining anything, and most importantly : seems like there's been some kind of mixing up during the transition from one version to another cause I'm now being drowned in preterit verbs that I have never seen and that the app assumes I know..."
"Once you're past the basics, you have to supplement your learning in other ways or you won't progress. I've gone over the word ""suitcase"" at least 100 times while words actually used in daily life are left out. Common sentences are never taught. I'm over a year in and I was asked to translate ""uno, dos, tres"". So again, past the basics, you're better off with a different program."
"I pay for the extra only because I make a lot of mistakes. I don't like how quiet the app is; I have to turn my phone volume so high. Nothing is explained phonetically, so you end up making the same mistakes because of a lack of understanding sentence structure. I turned off the leagues. People def cheat the system. You won't be able to use this app to become fluent. It's good for vocabulary and memorizing words, not actually speaking. Very school based vocab not what you'd use in everyday."
"Duolingo is a great language app that gives subscribers an unfair advantage over nonsubscribers. You'll love it if you subscribe to ad-free Super Duolingo. But, as the app warns, you will likely not complete a course if you don't subscribe and pay the lump sum annual fee. The ads are many and distracting. Features and points are fewer, lessons take longer and it's just not as much fun using the free version. Still, it's a good learning tool—if you can stand the nonstop ads and nag screens."
"Thank you for fixing the too long units issue in Spanish. It is the perfect size right now. It is doable in a week. Please don't change this again. People have yearly goals based on this. Also please bring back achievement progress bar. Update: The words in Spanish is a good addition. Please add a ""random"" sort option to study words at random"
"I am required in the daily quests to complete stories, but the app has skipped the last three stories without my being allowed to do them. In the past year, every single helpful feature has been removed. You never get an explanation for why something is wrong, only that it is. Most of the hints are misleading, so there's actually no teaching at all. Since the last update, I constantly get quests for speaking exercises even though I've had them turned off for months."
"Great app, I have a 50 day streak so far and it's really helped, I'm learning German but for some reason the for 1 and a half units are talking about things like ""The elephant is smart and tall"" like when will I ever need to say that ever? Also when trying to do the XP ramp up challenge for the leaderboard, I got the the very last challenge, I have done it like 5 times correctly and it refuses to complete it even with 100% accuracy and completion within the time limit."
"Fun, but not deep. Some errors in the lessons. Also, not as customized as they want you to believe. For instance, from time to time, it will want you to practice your ""weakest"" words. This is bogus. It randomly generates words, most of which you have never gotten wrong even once. But it's a pretty good app to get started on a language."
"I wish I could give 4.5 stars. The app is fun and educational. We sprung for the subscription. My wife and I are on German. We started with Spanish for awhile and then she did Greek an I did Italian. We prefer German so far. Less nonsense and more useful words. For instance, she had lots of pink stuff. I also think there is too much exact repetition. For instance, using the same exact picture and sentence to enforce a word. You just can do that without thinking at some point"
"I am giving this app a 1 star because they recently make some horrible changes they NEED to fix. They made the achievements so that you can't track your progress which makes it VERY difficult to set goals for yourself! I KNOW they can fix this because it tracks it until you get your 1st achievement and then you can no longer see your progress. If they fix this, I would give them a MUCH better rating. For now it is SO frustrating!!!!"
"It is an easy and great way to learn another language. The notifications are useful if you are busy. Edit. If I wanted to learn Arabic the first words to learn would be how to greet people, not noises used within the language and how to write them. Also, how many times in Spanish and French do we need to be reminded that the words taxi, hotel, and pizza are the same or very similar as in English. I have to watch adverts, I pay for super duolingo and it sometimes switches to the non paid version."
"They have the worst English translations for accepted answers when you're learning Chinese, forcing you to answer like someone who has never learned English before, or you get it ""wrong"". Absolutely terrible to release a language course in two such dominant languages, in our day and age, with literal millions of people who could have checked it for them and fixed it before it was launched. Answers like ""He has 3 friends really? ”....."
"Duolingo is a great tool to help learn a new language. It might have changed since I started my course, but I'd recommend they start courses with alphabet familiarity, rather than jumping straight into ""Where is the plaza"". aside from that, it's great. I am presently not under duress while writing this with a giant green owl in my living room. that'd be ridiculous."
"Overall it is a good app to learn the basics (only at the beginner stage) the only part that's frustrating in on the what do you hear sections that give you 4 options to pick from you don't get an Idea of what the words mean, just a sound to select and a correct or incorrect result... hoping that as I progress its more of a day to day conversation lessons that will be more helpful"
"Although I'm super appreciate this app being free it feels like a waste of time at the moment. I finished section 1 and it felt a little slow but I made good progress. Now I'm section 2 where I should be learning more and advancing my language skills, but I'm getting the same section 1 words presented as new, out of 10 ""new"" words there will be 1 actually new one. I can pass sections without mistakes by translating the 1-2 new words I'm supposed to learn in this ""level"". Looking for alternatives"
"It's a very amazing app helping people to learn a new language ,but I would appreciate if you just don't refresh the course and the progress daily because you have to start over and repeating everything again. it feels like you are not making any progress and sometime you loose the motivation to learn because you want to learn not to open the app everyday saying we refresh the course for you and I have to repeat everything I know already"
"The app has a very hard time detecting any voice input causing any voice input qurstions to be skipped. The developers should work harder on the voice input. The other language apps does have this issue. On top of the previous issue, Duolingo is unavailable to correctly keep a streak when the exercise span the day boundary. This is a very frustrating outcome from an app that prone consecutive usage. Life get in the way and I make the effort to learn at the end of the day."
All pronunciations disappeared after the february updates! I can also hear apps sound of the right and wrong answers as well as when the lesson ends. It's impossible to use the app for studying when you don't know how to pronounce the words! Listening exercises are no more. And also I've never been able to practice speaking because of the bug with micro. This is a huge disappointment
"Was great at first, but now that I am advancing, it is not very helpful. While it has you memorize use of words in different context and tenses, there are no explanations of why or language rules. I am constantly trying to figure out when changing tenses why some words you use on o and others you use an e or an a. Good for memorizing a language but not very helpful in understanding the structure or rules of a language. I think they are trying to make this a game rather than a tool."
"it's a great app. the graphics are cute, the layout is user friendly, the repetition makes it easy to pick up the language. that being said, the Match Madness excersizes make me want to kill myself. but whatever. I suppose I'll get more gems so that I can keep buying the time boosters because there is NO WAY TO DO ALL 4 MILLION MATCHES IN 1 MINUTE."
"I want to love this app. But keeping up with the lessons every day did not make me more conversational. I love the formula for the lessons, the intro to vocabulary, the repetition, hear and repeat, and forming sentences based on the lesson, but I'm not learning anything that will help me become fluent. The foundation for learning and retaining a new language is there, I just wish I was actually learning something I could speak and use in real life."
"Great way of learning a language. The hearts system is confusing and the badges thing should be optional. There is just 1 thing that would bring duolingo to a higher level: there should be buttons all over a lesson that would explain the grammatical rules of each practice. I am learning French and I'm not sure I make the same progress I would make if it would explain the complex system of times, clauses, and silent characters. After 50 days I still have to guess most of the grammatics."
"This app doesn't explain grammar or how the language works in its 'technicalities'. And that is very important. This app just throws you the exercise with the meaning of the words if you hover them. That's great for vocabulary, to memorise. But it fails miserably in other aspects. I wish they had a section with explanations, even if it's behind a pay wall. Also crashes in a middle of a exercise and I am forced to repeat the entire thing. It doesn't record progress. Very frustrating."
"It's very good but there are just a few frustrating aspects. If I skip or add a word on accident but I know better, it doesn't let me go back and correct it by myself until we are reviewing my mistakes. There could be more precise translation words when it gives us choices of what words to put to translate. Oh, and it keeps starting over each day. I'm not sure if that's a bug or just for review but it's really annoying and time consuming. 😂🤣 I'd give it 3 1/2-4 stars."
"I love Duolingo, but I'm not a fan of the recent updates. Also, the courses for languages that aren't major languages like French, Spanish, and German are hit-or miss. Latin is short and low-quality. Danish (my language of choice) is a hot mess - the English sentences are poorly edited and rarely make any sense. Not to mention that even though I'm on the family plan with two others who can access music and math, I cannot because I have an Android."
"Most recent updates to the app taking away predictive text makes for a poor user experience when a user knows the sounds of the words they're trying to spell in lessons, but may not necessarily know the spelling. Additionally, the shift in focus from humans creating lesson content/practice help to AI doing those things has tanked the quality of the language learning experience. Incredibly disappointed in the changes that have come through in the last year or so."
"I was a long-time user of this app casually. It was never an optimum way of learning a language, but used to be a nice way to supplement other learning methods. However, Duolingo has become progressively worse recently. Firstly, they removed all grammar explanations from the app. Additionally, and increasingly, previously free features are now behind paywalls, and un-skippable ads play frequently. The result is that duolingo is certainly not worth using now."
"They changed the entire way the app is a few months ago and my learning experience has declined significantly since then. Am on a 900 plus day streak and I still plan to cancel when my subscription is up. The way it used to be helped me learn so much more. This way seems very forced learning, you just have to be wrong and hopefully remember next time what the word means. Would not suggest duolingo."
"I like Duolingo so much. It's an excellent way to introduce us to a new language. Even when I support the gamificating as an funny way to learn the app doesn't necessarily must be focusing on competition. We need a part where grammar be explained, please. Guessing the way a sentence must be written is frustrating. So, less competition and more explanations. Thank you."
"It's adequate. I gave the free trial a shot, and was going to probably subscribe soon, but I have noticed that the lessons were all easy enough during the Super, but as soon as you aren't paying and you're limited on how many mistakes you can make without paying for premium, it starts throwing things at you to make sure you fail, to ensure you have plenty of incentives to give them money. And of course the 'practice your mistakes' mode is not a free feature. Pretty scummy tactics."
"The app has been crashing a lot lately, especially when loading tests that you pay 100 points to start, or when playing ads, which wastes your time when you're running timed XP boosters. Also, the Russian course does not recognize numbers spoken into the mic, even if you cheat and click the button to replay the sound clip that shows you how to pronounce the numbers in Russian right before you click the button to record your attempt. It makes you fail any speech lessons involving numbers."
"This is a very good app for learning but there are so many things that annoy me. First is that when in accidentally press ""learn new language"" it doesn't let me go out of it. And every time I close the app and open it again it stays the same. 2. When I press the button ""back"" on my phone it shows me the logo of duolingo to go to home and then it stays like that. It freezes everytime. 3. Although the game has many languages I do wish there would be the lanuage Maltese. Even though its unpopular."
"I used to love Duolingo. I have a 1,383 day streak. I even got Super for two years because I genuinely felt like it was worth it. The big update was annoying at first and there's still some changes I really don't like, but some things felt more intuitive at the same time. I've stuck with it. However, upon learning that the company has laid off contract workers in favor of using AI to write lessons, I have canceled my Duolingo Super subscription and I will be looking for a new app to learn on."
"There are many errors in the audio, for example in the Japanese courses. I have reported the errors several times within the app in the past 6 months, but it seems they are not resolving the problems reflected by the user actively enough. Also, in the personal practices, the same questions reappear so often that they've become a waste of time. I have written an email to report the issue two months ago, but the problem persists. To sum up, their trouble-shooting speed is too slow."
"I have 3 issues. I paid for a year subscription, yet the app is blocking me from accessing my account due to a bug in the app. The app is drilling the earliest words over and over while only repeating new words a couple of times. 3rd, I'm trying to learn Chinese and I find it does a terrible job at teaching both pinyin and the chinese characters. At this point, I think simple flash cards would be much more effective."
"Was good, excellent in fact. Making terrific progress. However last few days the app has appeared so buggy and so mamy issues. Tried emailing support but received nothing in return. App gives false notifications. No promotion due to bugs. No xp due to bugs. The thing is full of bugs. Update: tried clearing cache and destroyed all of my progress since last week??!!"
"For a basic build-up of vocabulary, duolingo can be good. Overall, though, this app is lacking and inconsistent. Constantly repeats the same 10 sentences for reading and some listening practices until you test out and then delivers completely new terms. This is not how learning a language works. The idea is to build up knowledge, not test unknown terms. Final level for 'Chinese' and Spanish is a basic intermediate level at best."
"I used to love Duolingo app 2-3 years ago, but not anymore. The update consisting the levels has made it less interesting to play/learn . If possible pls bring back the old feature . In addition to that pls remove the ads. It is so annoying. I know money necessary for the developers but I don't like the idea of 'pay to play' . I used to love the time when the stories were not fixed in the learning path but was kept separately. Pls pls bring back the old feature and I will surely give 5 stars."
"the lessons very simple to follow for the most part. Some of the character voices are difficult to understand at times. But the overall app is very well made. I've never received any type of errors. The way they have incorporated learning into a game format, helps to keep your attention. I was skeptical. Months went by where I thought ""I'm just not getting this"". After about 9-10 months, I started hearing Spanish sentences in songs,and I would recognize and understand Spanish written words."
"I've been using Duolingo for a few years now, and while I'm not fluent in conversation, I'm able to read my chosen language fairly well. I can also understand a large part of what people at the supermarket are saying in passing, which I think is a pretty strong point in the favor of this app. The hearts system will forever annoy me, because the app was honestly better without it. But I do like the changes they made to the Chinese course where you can learn pinyin and hanzi, that was much needed!"
"For the most part, this app is fantastic, it's really helped me to be able to learn new languages easily. I'd love to see Maori added to the list of languages available to learn. My only issue is with exp pots, I would like it if the app didn't automatically claim them and I had an inventory system to use them when I wanted. Sometimes I pop on for 5-10 minutes but then end up getting gifted exp that I then feel guilty for not wanting to use it then and there. Let me save them for later please!"
"Cute study app! I have been using it to study Japanese which is a language I already know a bit of. I hear the desktop version is better for learning but I have only used the app and that seems to only be a study tool. They don't explain things very well. I really dislike their league system and the reminders are really obnoxious. Even if you do your lessons everyday you can still get demoted. Not encouraging at all. You can't be in leagues with friends either, which is not fun."
"Really nice app!😀👏 It's just that it takes a very,VERY long time to load.🙁(example:when i press the ""Profile"" button,it takes so long to load that i just close Duolingo and i do something else.) I'm not saying its not good but i think there are a few bugs in the app. Last thing: When my friends look at my profile picture,there is no avatar! Otherwise, great app!😄❤️"
"If you are trying to learn a more unusual language it really doesn't help at explaining either the grammar or structuring of the language. The words aren't always pronounced especially if there are 2 words in place of one in English, the slower speak seldom works, which makes it difficult to understand. It seems that it is a one size fits all approach to language learning."
"fantastic, has voiced words mostly from what I've seen, with some A.I. filling in. lots of repetition and callbacks, fun little characters that are animated but don't interfere with learning, great stuff. ads dont interfere, just sometimes played at the end of lessons - catchy little ads for duolingo plus, wish it wasn't so expensive... you can totally still learn without it but it would be great to support an app that makes it so easy to learn"
"Fun, but the competition to complete lessons can be too distracting from the actual learning. Pop-up suggestions on how to remember what you learn are good tools. After completing several levels, still can't speak to anyone who knows how to speak Spanish. Lessons go quick, and knowing how to create and speak sentences in Spanish for a conversation is slow. Reading and writing Spanish developed quickly, but lessons make it easy to guess. On it's own, this app probably won't teach fluent Spanish"
"Was a great app, was very thorough and lots of material. Has ads but they're actually not that obtrusive. Unfortunately this app has deteriorated, with previously free features being stripped away, poor running with features load-locked and gems being taken for exercises that either won't load or won't complete. This is likely to push people towards super, which I actually would've bought if not for the poor quality. If it weren't the only place to learn Welsh, I'd avoid it entirely."
"App is usually simple to use, I am using it for Japanese. The biggest issue is the AI voices it uses, for a language like Japanese that has many similar sounds, it often makes me miss because the voice was not clear. It's also rather poor at teaching nuances it just gives you the questions and you tend to need to trial and error through. I am learning slowly, and the bite size lessons are great, but its sub to get more functions and less risk when getting things wrong is very pricey."
"Very easy to learn a new language with super duolingo. However, there is no way to get technical help or contact a rep. I lost a 1560-day streak because of a phone issue, and after many failed attempts to find customer service (I don't think they have one), I could not resolve the issue and lost the streak. Also there did not seem to be a way cancel the account,and they continued to charge me.After about a month my old info miraculously appeared, except for the streak. I dunno..."
"Duolingo is not only cute but insanely complex. Yes, you can learn over 10 languages but there's also a psychological memorization algorithm to how this works. It starts by putting basic information into your brain and giving it a good bit of work to slowly seep into your memory, then it gives you more little by little until you can remember the language clearly. That's only the simplified version of what really happens but it's so well thought out and really ingenious. Can't see notifications."
"Duolingo is nice to keep up with practicing but really suffers because you can't choose what to learn or focus on, and it really only does one kind of language learning. I am also not motivated by the artificial mechanisms that boil down to just allowing you to practice more, and all the gems and streaks and ""competition"" don't meaningfully affect the outcome of my learning. I pay for the app, and don't want all that not-what-I'm-here-for clutter and menuing."
"it's really helpful to compete with others every week. But the grammar is a bit neglected. Even new words comes without an article for the first time and one needs to sometimes figure out by yourself or search in other sources. ive also purchased the other most famous teaching app and their grammar is much better. but at the end duolingo has unmatched ability to keep me going and attentive to do every single day. The game also has serious glitches, it does not count properly and has tech issues."
"Duolingo is a really great app. I'd been practicing Spanish for a couple of months and stopped, but then I realised that when I could hear a basic Spanish sentence I could comprehend it. I went back on the app to continue my lessons. The app is built and functions in a way that subconsciously and consciously helps you to absorb the language. It's challenging and it focuses on all aspects of language learning (Speaking, reading, writing, etc) and the rewards and challenges keep me on my toes!"
"Update March 5 2024. I've paid for the premium version (now called super Duolingo) the last 4+ years now. The premium features simply not working consistently and seems to be getting worse. The latest example is the Review Mistakes feature. I made mistakes but nothing ever lists. Also, the unit rewind keeps repeating the same 2 lessons over and over. The stories also seem to cycle through 5 (and it doesn't even highlight which you haven't done like before. what's the point paying premium?"
"Decent introduction to the languages and nice vocabulary builder for new and returning language learners. Some good variety in lessons and examples, but minimal in explanations and can be a little too repetitive. Japanese course is missing speaking practice and more practical lessons like conversations. The hiragana, katakana and kanji is unnecessarily repetitive and takes too long to move on. Lastly the paid version does not have much advantage over the free version."
"Overall I like the app, but I don't like that you have to guess your way through a lot of lessons. Would be nice if there were multiple choices rather than to have to write a whole sentence. The spelling of words is the most difficult part. Also the option in each section where you can collect extra stars should actually pertain to that that section as a refresher and not be random."
"Regardless of the quality of the language teaching, which is so so, this is not a finished app. Quality of performance is worse than any app I've ever used. Can't use it for more than like 10 minutes before it slows my entire phone down to a crawl (no other apps have this problem). To even be able to get a modest amount of learning in in a day requires 1-2 complete restarts of the app. I know this is a common problem with others, but they refuse to do anything about it. Cannot recommend, fix plz"
It is the worst! For the free day trial when it would remind me before it ends two days before it didn't! Plus when I put or spoke the right answer it said it was wrong! It doesn't even make a fun like a game!Plus with the hearts I just can't! If you lose all of you hearts you cant learn anymore! I find that very sad yet dispointing!Wouldn't want to waste my time on this stuff! I don't recommend it for you guys! One last thing I had to pay more for the free trial!
"As an app on Android, it had worked smoothly, but starting freezing and rebooting the mobile (Android 13, Xperia 5 IV). It can happen two-or three times a day, is not related whether to charging or device temperature. Clearing cache has not resolved the issue. Update (April 2024): the problem dissappeared. Most likely due to fixing the bug in the app."
"1. Please allow us to move the word boxes around in the sentence. It is very frustrating if you forgot one word and have to start all over. This used to be possible a few years ago. 2. When we use voice for numbers, and your programme translate those into numbers (instead of text) amd then you mark that as false.. very frustrating as well. I feel like those are simple implementations that could make a nice difference. Also add some grammar tips to your app to dominate the world"
"It's a good language-learning app, it just doesn't give you enough education in the language. And it is sometimes unhelpful, such as how the Arabic course teaches you a rarely used dialect and the Portuguese course only teaches you Brazilian Portuguese. But overall it was pretty helpful for me, I just don't know where to go to become fluent without having to pay."
"It's good in concept, and obviously popular, and the lessons are well designed. But... I just want the language exercises. I don't want them interrupted every 90 seconds for unskippable dopamine-hit gaming reward animation stuff. And blocking lessons with a video ad for the paid version every 3 to 4 minutes is much more likely to make me abandon it entirely than to pay up for Super mode."
"Please stop forcing Super Duo trials on me. I don't like/want it. Wish they'd add story time + speaking to Hebrew. Good for getting a grasp on a new language, though. Update: Newest version took away all discussion boards, which were a great way to get advice & be able to hear almost every sentence. We now lose hearts practicing old lessons if we click into specific ones, which disincentivizes practicing old lessons. The path update forces you to new materials too fast, so you don't learn well."
"Duolingo was amazing before the current update now. I miss the repeated lessons & crowning levels. It made diffenciating lessons easy. But now its all mixed in with old & new/unfamiliarized questions, plus the update lags so hard. And, there's no hearing the sentences in the lessons once completed anymore which is really unfortunate. It's frustrating to learn sentences when I've never came across them before. I liked how it was a year ago."
"This is a painless and fun way to learn a new language! The system is highly motivational and encourages daily practice to speed up progress , so I am very happy with Duo. The only slight reservation is that the translations/vocabulary are American English which can sometimes be confusing for a UK learner! Apart from that, I can highly recommend Duo!"
"Great at teaching very basic stuff. But spends more time trying to be a game than a teaching app. Often just throws words at you and expects you to know them right away, then punishes you for getting them wrong. When it works, it creates a great cycle of engagement, but when it doesn't, it creates a vicious cycle of discouragement. Fun app, but not great for teaching."
Has been very good up to now but it seems to have a major glitch in last 3 weeks and I'm stuck in a Groundhog day loop constantly repeating Unit 6 of the Spanish course! This happens after a screen message appears stating: 'We're syncing your progress to new and improved Spanish course content.' it's very frustrating. I've contacted Duolingo support but have not received any answer.
"I love this! It's super easy to help you learn languages, and learning Spanish couldn't be simpler. But, on my phone, I'm 3 days behind on my streak than I am on my iPad. I'm on 24 days on my iPad, while on my phone it says I'm on 21. And the Duo widget NEVER loads for me. Plus, when I accidentally clicked free trial, it would let me cancel the free super duo trial until it finished. But overall, this app is super simple to help learn languages and I heavily recommend it everybody."
This is a very good app to accompany you when learning a new language. It keeps you quite engaged and motivated. Since the discussions/forum part was removed from the exercises the App keeps you guessing what the rules are to the sentences you are learning. For example there is now no way to know why a sentence is formed in a certain way without leaving the app and googling or opening an actual grammar book. Quite frustrating.
"Recently the speech broke for me. I can no longer do speaking exercise. It just doesn't allow me any time to speak before it jump to complete. It has been happening consistently. Please fix it in future release. Still unfixed, had to leave Duolingo and unsubscribed for the next year. This is really frustrating. after using it for a few years, I won't come back until they fix various bug from Android side. So disappointing."
"I have been on Duolingo since last January, almost a year. I am on level 8 and there is a bug that does not permit me to check an answer. I have reported the bug but there is absolutely no communication as to what action if any is being taken. Very disappointed with this app. To continue to learn Spanish I will have to try another app. I was making progress learning Spanish and frustrated by the way this is managed. Terrible!! I am dissatisfied and would never recommend Duolingo."
"I find that learning French this way is challenging. Often there are no references to the correct way to conjugate the verbs. Even the examples won't show the correct choice. So I use the example and get it wrong. Also, the speaking lessons often don't hear what I am saying when though I say the phrase exactly correct. They say learning English is very difficult. Well, the French don't say half of the letters in any given word, so how is one supposed to know that?"
"Good for learning. But some issues. I pay for it but leave heart's on so I can try harder to learn, but I can't do practice to recover more hearts when I pay for it like the unpaid version. Which is annoying to lose functionality after you pay for something. Also I like the animations on duo but don't like samsung animations when changing apps. And if I turn off the samsung animations it turns off the duo lingo animations. Even if it is toggled on in the settings of the duo app."
"inconsistent with what passes as correct answers, (spelling errors etc) will auto select answers so you get wrong answers and lose stars. Constant ads. They just want you to pay for subscriptions. I've also been told by finnlanders that this isn't the language/ grammar used for actual conversations. In my opinion if you can afford it go with another app"
"Great app! I'm a visual learner and the audio lessons, YouTube, and even flashcards don't work for me. I need to see the written word in a context and associate it with an image in order for me to assimilate new vocabulary. It works better for me than Memrise does, because it covers the grammar and Memrise doesn't. Duo also has stories and mini games which make the language learning more entertaining, which is a key to success for an ADHD person like me."
"My experience would be much better if Duolingo didn't have so many bugs. Or, at least, if their support team really tried to solve the problems and not only sent you letters kinda ""We've received your report, thank you!"". One of the bugs is especially discouraging. Duolingo takes off your XP! For example, you gained 75 XP at level 12 of Match Madness, but Duolingo adds up only 60 XP to your score! I've found out on Reddit that this bug is more than a year old, and Duolingo still hasn't fixed it."
"I have enjoyed using duolingo for over a year now. Though I haven't appreciated some of its more recent updates. It is slowly becoming more game style and less educational. But after trying other language apps, I've still always come back to duolingo. It doesn't teach you the language rules, etc, but I find it very helpful to learn new words and help me stay familiarized with the language as I learn it through BJU's curriculum."
"The app has mostly worked fine, but lately, I keep passing level 30 in French, starting level 31, only for the app to reset overnight to level 30. Then I jumped ahead to level 32 and did a couple more activities, only to get reset to midway through level 31. I have no way of contacting an actual person over this and can only submit a bug report that just gets an automated response. I'm not sure if there's any point to using this app going forward."
"A good app to learn the basics, but I've just encoutered a major problem : xhile leasing Chinese, I had progressed to stage 4 and was in the middle of it. But they implemented a major change in the order in which we're learning the words and sentences. As a result, some levels are now considered as completed (stage 1, 2 and 3), but for some of them, it's not what I've learned. I basically have to erase everything and redo it, as I've missed some vocabulary and grammar because of that."
"App is generally great but falls down badly when doing speaking exercises with short (one or two syllable) phrases. It often fails to recognise short phrases, across several languages. Tested this with a native speaker in Turkiye, where Duolingo failed to recognise him speaking his own language. The result is a long list of ""mistakes"" you can't get rid of. EDIT Feb 2024: There are still issues with voice recognition, but it seems they no longer appear as mistakes which need to be fixed."
"What happened??? Why get rid of predictive text??? I'm dyslexic and need predictive text for regular English, there's no way I can actually learn a language without it. There goes my over 200 day streak. Real bummer this has become a part of my daily routine but now that it's not accessible, I can't put the additional time and effort needed to do lessons without the predictive text features. Really truly disappointed."
"I WANT TO USE THE JAPANESE *KEYBOARD* - I'm a subscriber and up to Section 2 of the Japanese course. One of the first things I did was disable Romanji, but I still feel like I'm just learning Duolingo rather than Japanese. By that I mean, there's always just a few choices and it's pretty easy to eliminate some choices and remember patterns to get answers. But this won't help me in the real world where there's countless possibilities and I have to actually understand. I need freeform input!"
"There are problems with both the language I am learning not being presented correctly and with the English used. There is no learning of grammar rules, and it can be very repetitive. The app itself is also very unstable and will hang frequently, which is especially annoying if you lose XP during a 2x period. There's adds after every lesson but half of them are from Duolingo themselves selling the Super or Family plan. However, overall, it's a fun way to learn basic phrases of a language."
"Duolingo is fun, the animations, voices and characters with their different personalities makes it so much better than all the other language-learning apps and websites I've tried. I don't use premium, but I got GIFTED it as a prize in one of the treasure boxes for three days and it was completely free!! My only problem is that it shouldn't take a premium to review our mistakes, and we should get more of the blue coins more often, as I want to make everything Legendary but it is hard to save up"
"I love this app. It really helps me sharpen my listening skills. I'm building my vocabulary and I'm understanding more of what I hear. However, after playing for 64 days my only complaint is that the Legendary Lessons has a major glitch that needs to be fixed ASAP! Oftentimes when trying to translate a sentence the letters turn red indicating that the word cannot be chosen thus forcing me to forfeit that lesson altogether. This has been happening for a few weeks now. Please help!"
So far so good. There are lots of languages to choose. I am at the beginner level and it seems very beginner to me. There is repetition to help reinforce learning and they have a streamline way to respond to questions. The lessons are bit size so it's long enough impact but not to long to feel like a chore. Even the ads are placed in a pretty good spot after a lesson which gives users a mini break. It's not perfect but I would def recommend and have. It's free with an option to upgrade.
"now I've been using it for a while. I still think it is good, but extremely annoying . it's South American, not Spanish. It's designed to annoy you into paying for. the main encouragement is the competition, which is addictive but impossible to win without paying. they also give you rewards, but also remove them often. then we have adverts that regularly crash to delay and demotivate you unless you pay, but then who could expect more?"
"Great for beginners. I haven't used it to learn more advanced topics but it's a great collection of words, pronunciations and phrases to get you thinking in the language you wish to learn. Edit: lowered from 5 to 3 stars due to the recent update removed gboard's predictive text. This was a poor decision. Without this, there's less benefit to using the mobile version or to pay for a subscription. Second edit: raising back to 5 stars since they quickly fixed the issue with predictive text"
"Update: I've been on this app for a while now, however the formatting they have taken up in recent years is disappointing to say the least. Older features such as coments/ explanations underneath each phrase as well as older lessons breaking in order to properly review them are the very reason that kept many productive and knowledgeable within their learning. The constant push to ""upgrade"" to premium is detrimental to the community to say the least. I will continue to use in hopes they change."
"I miss when my feed was all about my friends accomplishments and less about random duolingo articles I do not care about. I want to see what my friends are doing and send congrats to keep ourselves motivated, not learn about soccer and football. The translations have also been a bit weird lately, as someone who is mostly using the app to review/keep up practice with a language rather than learning from zero. The app used to be better."
"The overall experience is ok. The translation questions sometimes demand improper english or odd phrasing. The app doesn't give an explanation for why you missed a question. Sometimes you get the translation they were looking for, or an occasional example that has nothing to do with the question you missed. It not only fails to clarify much, it prompts ""was this a good explanation?"" without any option for no. There's bugs too. I've learned a lot of words, but no real way to use them together."
"There are many good things about Duolingo and I have learnt a lot in a few months, but it could be much better. There isn't enough explanation for why certain words or grammar are used. There isn't an option for choosing what you learn - I'm learning Spanish for a holiday and so don't really need to plough through sections on education and work. It constantly says I'm learning a new word for words that have been taught previously, and the speaking exercises are hit or miss."
It's not perfect but it's free. It sometimes makes mistakes and mixes up words like pen apple and house but only rarely. This is an excellent app for schools A teacher or a substitute teacher can teach any language without needing to know it. just assign the students to the appropriate classes assign them points to accumulate and let them go
"If you are beyond very basic level, the app doesn't teach anything. Its only good to practice the knowledge you gained elsewhere. Even though, if the app thinks you answer the question wrong, in majority of cases it doesn't explain why it was wrong, so again, no teaching here. Also the same questions are being repeated from class to class and from level to level. I only use it for practice the grammar, but learn Spanish using other sources."
"App is great, customer service not so much. Somehow got my path unlocked by 8 whole sections, and I then had to manually go back and find where my progress was. Also, i was no longer receiving rewards for chests along my path as they were already open. Sent in a help ticket on 3/13/24 and have gotten zero response from Duolingo. It's a fun app, but 2 stars and a canceled subscription due to the lack of assistance."
"Samsung S23 Ultra (Android). I've been using Duolingo for almost two years now (started JUN 2022). Upgraded to a S23 Ultra in MAY 2023 from a S10, but still having trouble with the app freezing upon opening. About once a week (or more often) I have to Force Stop the app because it won't open. Also, would be nice to know what I did wrong, if I make a mistake (not all errors show corrections). What happened to the tip-suggestion area for each question in a lesson?"
"I like this app very much, it is by far the best free app for learning a foreign language if one is too busy for intensive classes, but in he whole of the Champion Section we've been repeating the same questions all over again, with very limited vocabulary. How many times can we repeat a sentence like:"" The demand for ducks with red coats had begun""???"
"the only reason I do not rate 5 stars is because tracing characters (for these types of languages) is odd on a PC versus a mobile screen. it would be nice to have a chance to be warned before a tracing lesson, or have the option to do them later, similar to the listening exercises. everything else is great. love learning on this app."
"It was a great app when I joined in 2020. Took a year off. The new structure is useless. Learning Concepts and Grammer concepts are not even introduced. The so-called Guidebooks are also useless. You are asked to pick the pronunciation between 2 words & not told what the word means. It's just conversations. USELESS. You have to introduce gender concepts, grammar and verb tense usage etc. to learn. Just throwing new words at you without any explanation is ridiculous."
"Wish there was more explanation (e.g. verb tables, plural rules etc) and it is REALLY annoying that English is American English, with no option for British English. Yes, I can usually work it out, but it slows me down (and many challenges are timed in duolingo) and is confusing. The language I'm learning often shares words with British English, that I then need to translate to American! Plus, presumably everyone learning English will be learning American English with no choice 😔"
"My husband & I started duolingo together & have been impressed with the program. Working through the language in a variety of ways is very helpful. I do recommend doing the membership it allows for unlimited attemps, where the free method you get hearts and with each mistake you loose a heart. When the hearts are gone no more practice. Making the program not as productive or beneficial. The repetitive nature is the key to learning a new language."
"A restructuring of the Chinese course has completely messed up everything. For some reason I had to relearn some courses that I've already learned. What's worse is that the course made me skip some lessons I've haven't done yet. It now assumes that I know around 30 or so words that were never taught. Me keeping notes have just gone out the window, guess I was a fool for trying to organize them. I've canceled my premium subscription, will stop using the app once it runs out."
Is worth it but half the time any answer you put will either not be selected or the app will not mark it as correct. The more language corces you do the slower the app runs and it won't always start on the language you changed it to. The app doesn't teach you the grammatical system in a way that you learn and requires you to have enough intellect to figure out the languages grammatical system on your own.
"I've known about duolingo for a long time but heard some negative things in the past, so didn't download it. years on, I decided to give it a go and now wish I had done it sooner. It works well along other sources of learning and it's been a big motivator to get me learning daily. Something I struggle with having ADHD. so glad I downloaded it now. It's a fun way to learn and I seem to memorize better learning this way. I'm so pleased it's free and watching ads is a small price I am happy to pay."
"so I hate how the volume levels of the voices are so different. did anyone think to use a mixing g board while recording audio? also it never hears the first word I say, and even when I say things correctly it doesn't register. I pay for premium the least you could do is adjust the audio. Also I get a lot wrong answers because the app is often grammatically incorrect how you gonna teach someone English if you don't know the difference between 'used to' and 'use to'"
"Just used the app for the first time in a couple of years, and it has gone downhill. Has become a typical annoying app begging for money and forcing you to watch ads. The pronunciations audio clips are inconsistent and are not great for teaching how words sound. Used to be much better and I could easily knock out an hour of learning. Now I think I will delete my account"
"Powered by AI? A recipe for disaster. After a 400+ days streak I've decided to uninstall. They laid off a LOT of people and replaced them with AI, but the AI isn't even good! There's A LOT of mistakes in most languages, weird grammar that a native speaker would NEVER dare pronounce and, of course, an absurd amount of straight up incorrect translations, losing the true meaning of idioms and the nuances of the language. I'll be back when you hire HUMANS and re-open the forums."
"I love this app!!!!! the lessons are short, helpful and help you learn efficiently! it's a shame sometimes you run out of hearts and have to quit that lesson for 24hrs or something, and it would be nice if they introduced a community bit maybe so you can practise speaking/writing the language with actual people 😅 bit I love it so much and it really does help soooo much when trying to learn difficult new phrases and grammar!!!!!!"
"Do NOT care about their (free) customers! Since the redesign, things have changed for the worse. The tips before lessons have been replaced with unhelpful ""guidebooks"". The helpful ability to comment was disabled on Android. Now there's no help or reasons given when something is new. There's no learning, only memorization. Learning went from fun to being a chore. This review was 1st left 6 months ago. Still no response. I email them often, but get no response since I quit the paid version."
"A good way of learning a completely new language for this beginner. Lots of nudges to keep you engaged. Every now and then there are words that are not explained before they are used, but most of the time you can click on them to see what they mean or you soon learn them. The app functions well, I've had no crashes or bugs. Adverts are not too intrusive as they appear between lessons, and there is a way to pay for an advert free version with many other benefits. Yo soy muy feliz con Duolingo."
I just started the app. I did have previous experience with Spanish the language I wanted to learn first. I didn't feel my knowledge of Spanish would be enough to start at a harder spot so I started at the beginning. The app does offer the option to test your knowledge for a starting point too. I just wanted to start from the beginning. I am still using it on the free play plan. Using watching ads to keep it free for me. Mi español es improving but I haven't learned it all yet. It teaches to rea
"I don't know if this will happen if you continue your lessons, but as a native Vietnamese speaker, the Vietnamese selection is not accurate. Sure, it is accurate for certain topics, but most of the time, not. The app only uses one version/dialect for words and does not differentiate between ""pronouns."" The pronunciation is also from one dialect, not others. It is, btw, too formal. For example, you would not have to say ""xin lỗi"" every time, like ordering food, unless you're sorry for something."
"Very good. This app provides you with a lot vocabulary and after a time you can build long sentences and learn a language very quickly. Duolingo is also very colorful and has systems like streaks and your stats that motivates you to keep learning a new language. Me personaly having a Spanish class, it really helped me get a head start over other students. So if you are looking for an app that really teaches you a new language, then Duolingo will not let you down."
"Devs could think more about league allocation. My husband is very competitive.He will play as long as it takes to stay at the top. He often gets put in easy leagues so he doesn't have to do much = less adverts. I am less competitive. I get put into challenging leagues with superusers where I'd have to play full time to succeed! So I do the minimum as I know there's little hope of advancing = less adverts. If the leagues were better set, we'd both do more = more adverts, happy users & advertisers"
"I've used duolingo every day for a year to practice Japanese, but I find the constant (unannounced) course updates are increasingly making the app unusable. It's really frustrating to log on and find that every few months you're suddenly at a completely different place in the course, with random content which is either too easy/hard or contains new kanji you are expected to 'know'. Japanese duolingo also lacks content (eg stories) and doesn't teach kanji well. I might find another app instead."
"After the recent update, I can't play because it always says ""you are offline"" even when my wifi is on. I'd like this to be rectified and what's up with the constant update, New problems keep arising for me after every new update. With the new update, the app just got worse, I can't practice, it keeps closing and now my streak has been reset, I think I'll have to delete this app it's becoming a total waste of space"
"Animations for words appearing on the word-match exercises are too slow. They take forever to appear on both columns, all the while the clock dwindles. They should appear instantly, not fade in like a bad Powerpoint. I get ""speedy"" grades on the regular levels but those bonus levels are ""merde"". I'm not playing it again until this is fixed as i don't like leaving levels behind without obtaining all stars. I'll maybe use Babbel instead. Frustrating as i'd sank a couple of weeks into Duo."
I have loved this app and been a user for the past decade but have noticed some bugs that should be fixed. The app glitches frequently and restarts and freezes often. I've reported these glitches and they do improve for a short time. It makes me not want to purchase the Duolingo plus edition. This really sucks to write this but it's true. Also lessons no longer have a proper grammar section that would enhance the lessons. Just sentences that are vaguely similar to that lesson.
"Korean: A bunch of the audio files for Korean are really really bad, they are glitchy and jittery sounding. There is no way you can learn Korean using this app alone. It can be a good supplemental source when using something else as your primary. However, these corrupted audio files can still be very frustrating and unhelpful. I would say absolutely do not pay for this app if this is the language you are wanting to learn."
"It's a fun refresher game to do alongside learning a new language, and I appreciate that the only ads I'm getting are for their other services. But while doing these exercises, I'm often thrown words that I haven't been taught in the Duo lessons, and I do think that while the lesson guides are helpful to some extent- they don't necessarily cover everything in the lessons. It can be a bit vague."
"I am using the free version for French and learning a lot! Practicing to earn hearts is a good thing, but there are lots of opportunities with the paid version too (I won 3 free days), so you will be able to achieve your language goals with either one. The app could benefit users by making a ""theory"" tab or something to teach users about the finer points of language use (fem/masc, plurals, origins, etc). One has to dig a bit for this knowledge in the app. Très bien! 🦉💚"
"Somehow they managed to push out updates to make the UX significantly worse than it was before, and it was bad enough then: now it has a number of unskippable animations that ignore the Animations setting and significantly increase the time it takes to do anything on the app; it continues to load keyboards that aren't installed but now it also straight-up loads the wrong keyboard at times; the voice recognition is still awful. There are better alternatives out there."
"While I've enjoyed and learned a lot from duolingo in about a years time, they've changed the course I've been taking three times in the duration. One of the core features of duolingo is its ability to teach you language, add on top of what you already know, and refresh your knowledge periodically. Unfortunately, in the latest update to my language course, I now have tens, if not hundreds of words that duolingo says I've learned, but have never seen before. There is no way to relearn these words"
"Used to be a huge fan, haven't used for a couple of years, now it's littered with ads, pesters you constantly if notifications are turned off, it has a limit on the amount of time you can use it and when I was brushing up on my skills and when translating ""Wien is great"" and I got it wrong for using Großartig instead of Super, I knew it was time to install something else like Memrise. I wonder if that has also gone rapidly downhill from where it was a few years back."
"Ever since the Japanese course on the app was updated, I've noticed this frustrating issue where the app isn't correctly placing where I am in the lessons. For example, I noticed I've done 4 lessons in one bubble, but when i close out of the app and restart it, it shows I've only done one. It's kind of irritating, so please fix this as soon as possible."
"I absolutely love DuoLingo! I knew some very basic Spanish but wanted to improve as we were headed to Mexico for a month. I've been able to have conversations with the locals! Amazing. I love that there are different characters with different accents, tone, speed, etc. Different ways to reinforce the learning and very motivating with the challenges. Highly recommend!"
"Excellent app for learning new languages. Definitely motivated by the leadership board but also by the threatening and or disturbing messages I get, terrorizing the other characters or threatening me and my family personally, and the horrifying late night images on the widget. There are a lot of languages to choose from too which is pretty cool. 5 Stars would recommend."
"App suddenly has a bug. No XP despite earning it. Double XP chests haven't activated. Not recognising my progress for the league - so I'm stuck at the bottom, despite completing enough lessons to be at the top. I've also ended up paying for the app for a year as I thought it was £4.99 a month and planned to cancel the ad free version after one month. Gutted to see £60 has gone from my bank account and will auto renew in a year's time. Achievements hadn't activated either. Disappointing."
"I have reduced my mark because some of the English grammar used in Duolingo is poor. For example for loud music the English translation is ""full blast"". At best this is American slang. The correct translation should be "" at full volume"". Also the use of ""gotten"" is incorrect. The correct translation should be ""became"" Because of this type of thing I find myself bring marked as incorrect when I am answering correctly."
"Is a good app. But have technicals problems like, when I finish a lesson and I press continue, I can't continue with my next lesson, doesn't stop loading and I have to close the app, lose my day progress and do everything again. Also, sometimes a make like 200 EXP and looks like I didn't do anything, I stay in the same position. I would like them to fix these few problems that I mention because there are more. Thank in advance."
"A very good app, easy way to develop a habit of daily practice. This app is a good conversation companion you have no one to practise with. I like the way the lessons build on each previous one. The reading lessons that seem to throw words at you that you never came across before! Well I suppose it makes your learning muscles strain harder to develop faster. One more thing, when you say something is free then let it all be free 😁. That for me is what holds back my fifth star for the app."
"I've studied Spanish off & on throughout my adult life, from high school, thru college & beyond. I have never been able to learn so quickly & retain all the info so easily, while having fun, than I have with DUOLINGO. My only complaint about the free app is that some of the ads can be way too long & annoying. But it is free, so I can't complain too much."
"Good app. I use Duolingo to improve spanish, and because there is no option to choose my native language, I have to choose english as the other one, although I have to improve my english as well. Because of that, sometimes it is very confusing and difficult to understand at first, and than to translate formulations, such as, for example: Luis siempre se pone vestidos rojos?! I know it's a dress but I doubt all the time. It makes me unsure and unsecure. Beside that, it is fun and useful app."
"Many of the practise phrases are in the wrong order pedagogically. In language-learning a learner should hear the phrase first, then fill in a single word gap in a phrase, then reproduce the phrase after hearing it spoken. Finally the learner translates the full sentence from English into the target language. In many of the sections, this final phase comes first, then the other, less difficult phrases follow randomly. This happens throughout the Italian course and needs modification."
"Updated unexpectedly and completely reorganized the lesson plans, throwing me into a unit where I was totally unprepared. Now I have to start over, because the earlier lessons contain vocabulary that wasn't trained pre-update, but it still counts this as ""review"" (even though I never got to learn it before), which awards a measly 5xp per lesson. Absolutely aggravating."
"I was learning chinese, but recently, the course seems to have updated. The sync that happened wasn't done properly and the course has worsened. I just started unit 3 of chapter 1 before the update, but now this unit has been shifted to become unit 1 (which doesn't make sense). The biggest problem is that Duolingo thinks I have completed the current unit 1 as well as a part of unit 2, while I had only done one circle of unit 3. Now I can't continue learning properly. Please don't delete units."
"So much to love, with engaging lessons, the romanji option as well as learning hiragana. The negative is that there's a LOT of repetition on each lesson, which not everyone needs. Also lots of questions like ""where is the airport"", which no-one asks, with smartphones and googlemaps now! I'd prefer more vocabulary options earlier, like flashcards to start building more nouns in a memory bank."
"Pretty decent. But the ads after every lesson and limited hearts make learning a language needlessly harder. I only got the ads after going onto the app and haven't checked the web version since, so maybe that version doesn't have as many ads. Also, if you run out of hearts,then you either need to gain more through paying with crystals (things you get either through quests or irl money) or doing some practice for one more heart. If you run out then you stop. Overall, it's not the worst nor best."
"They updated it recently, at least the Chinese lessons, and added new words and characters in sections and units I've already completed in their entirety. This means I have to go all the way back to the beginners lessons just to learn new words that could've easily been placed in a newer, separate section. This is just counterproductive and frustrating because I like organization, and this just screwed over my pacing."
"I don't like the change to the learning path. It doesn't feel well structured. XP is harder to earn. Lesson states XP for a specific lesson, but after completing it I was awarded less XP. In some cases XP was not awarded at all. I have lost interest in the app and now feel unmotivated to do multiple lessons. The changes seem geared towards forcing you to complete the learning path in order to earn any XP, and penalises you by awarding a tiny amount of XP for practicing earlier lessons."
"While I'm happy with the format of the app, the review part needs some work. I could play it a hundred times and nothing would change. The reviews only show me lessons I've learned recently and I'm starting to forget the basic words from the beginning of the course. Every course or platform is a completely different experience too. Web has the vocab which I would love to do on the app but tough luck, I've heard of events I've never even seen on my course, and quests are different on web and app"
"I am just shocked how most of the lessons in almost all the units are organised. When you run out of heart to use, you can practice even more to gain heart I've learnt a lot from this app but the only short coming that I think it has is that you cannot get to know your (Quest) buddies unless you've meet in person or know each other from somewhere It would have been good to have some quest that you can complete with a friend that is active. But all in all, this app is Maverick. Merci, Duo😁"
"I do not understand the software development and testing process they use at Duolingo! Honestly! For years and years we see the same problems coming back all the time. Currently, the problem is that Today's review is stucked to Listen-up. I did like 20 of listening exercises in a row - it sux! Killing Duo is not helping. Alo, all books are marked read when I arrive to them. Kind of difficult to get daily achievements! Argh!"
"I used to enjoy the app, leaning a new language was fun and excited. but it sucks that you guys care more about money than providing a good, (mostly) free, accurate language learning app. getting rid of translators to use AI has made it unfun and annoying. hearing words pronounced incorrectly, being told my answers (which I know are correct) are wrong, the accents are odd, etc. I am undownloading, and will consider re-downloading if you bring back actual, human translators."
"Duolingo definitely got more cash grabby, and hasn't put much thought into the system to let their users actually learn, for example, the streak freeze costs less than a heart refill, which doesn't incentivize theusers to actually keep working. Also, it shows that the premium subscription is needed to actually learn seriously. Imagine you need to learn a new language for travel and you have to pay with gems to keep going lmao. Other than the downsides, still an app I frequently use."
"I enjoy the learning in a game, it's very engaging! It is fun, and the sound effects motivate me to continue playing. However, the gems you can win to continue advancing to higher skill levels is RIGGED to force you to pay money for more gems. And the coast of more gems is not reasonable at all. The coast of certain things is so ridiculous relative to what you recieve for it, and their are challenges that can't be beaten without paying for more time, which is un ethical for a learning app. 👎🏿"
"I've been using Duolingo for over five years. The most recent thing that has been happening is that I will do a lesson or two and when I log in the next day, I'll get a notification saying that they ""updated course content,"" it will start me over in that lesson. It will be the same exact content and lesson I did the day prior. I can't make any progress because each day it sets me back to lessons I've already done. Very frustrating. I've stayed with it so long and I hate to cancel it over this."
"This app is really good. I like how if you can't speak into the mic or listen you can tap the ""Can't listen right now"" option and it'll give you the option to listen and talk into the mic 15 minutes later. and when its teaching you new words for one lesson it'll focus mainly on one word, then in the other lessons it'll include new words and old ones you've learnt. I'm learning German and I've had this app since yesterday and I already love it. strongly recommend duolingo!!!"
"At first I loved this app. But a year in, and I'm getting utterly fed up. It begins failing your answers for the stupidest of reasons, continually running you out of hearts and gems, so having invested a year of your life already, you are more likely to get your wallet out. And I'd happily pay, but not more than I pay for Netflix each month. I've checked my failed answers on translation apps, and they are correct. I'm also sick of the updates, which completely changes where you were up to."
"Very flawed. Terrible lag after studying for more than 30 minutes makes it almost unusable. Many times it freezes and does not count points earned. Several times it has marked me as incorrect where I have used a word that means the same thing. Some open ended questions are marked wrong when what I have written is grammatically & factually correct, just not the answer the app was looking for. Overall a good idea, badly implemented. Would give it zero stars if possible. DO NOT PAY FOR THIS."
"Duolingo is an app that at any upgrade you'll get something better every time from the app. Duolingo also makes the learning seem more fun and there are many persuasive things that make you want to come back and continue learning, like the streak, friend quest being promoted to the next league, it even sends reminders a lot. So all in all I think it's a very nice app"
"I am learning so much with the free version. The lessons have various ways of learning that keep me engaged and I love keeping my streak...it's very motivating. I have tried another similar app, but I must say, this is my favourite! Using the app is handy for anywhere, but using it online skips the ads. I use both. If there were a lifetime subscription I would purchase it! Absolutely recommend this!"
"Too much repetiton, often answers are limited to particular combination of words an sentences. Progress is too slow. Many ads. I don't feel that I improve my language much, skipping to topics or levels you would like to try its nearly impossible, tho whole level feels extremely easy, but misstakes are counted to their very specific way of translating the sentences, its very inflexible and not smart at all. Stakes system is horrible. No regular updates or improvements. And much more..."
"the new interface is really limiting and feels counterintuitive to language learning. it's not a linear process and the new structure is painful to use edited to add, I still feel this way, and with the new structure it's even harder, especially in the writing/learn hanzi part. the second character it has you learn 咖 has so many strokes"
"Pros: gamified element+ repetition makes it easier to learn a lot of vocab words. Cons: everything else. After a certain point I had to go to another app to learn actual grammar because Duo doesn't break the gaming to explain anything & assumes you'll just figure it out. Early on you can, further in no. But I had enough sunk cost by then to succeed beyond Duo. Also I'm good with freemium either giving me ads or hounding me to upgrade, but they do BOTH exhaustively and it gets REALLY OLD FAST."
"it would be good to be told the rules as you go along. There used to be some help guidance but that that seems to have been removed. And also it would be nice to have an adult's version rather than teenager. Duolingo talks too much about things like teeth braces, exams, what clothes go with each other and so on. Not really very useful for adult conversation. Oh and it's very American. You have to learn two languages as you go along! I've slowly reduced my score because of these things."
"Got the option for a 14 day trial of duolingo super. Duolingo promised they would notify me 2 days before the trial ended, in case I decides to cancel. I never received the notification about the trial ending. None of the emails I received recently had anything to do with it. I cancelled super the same day I was charged, and was told I wouldn't be refunded. I attempted to reach out to their customer support via email, but haven't received a reply."
"Duoling once was good. It lacked on explanations of gramatical concepts but filled the need for a practicing tool well. Unfortunately it has consecutively been changing to the worse. About a year ago they took away the ability to pick your own lessons and now you are forced to do endless senseless repetitions. Using it now is like a painful grind to fulfull their gamified goals, it's absolutely demotivating."
"Have been using this app for more than a year. Really appreciate being encouraged in the daily lesson(s) habit. It has dramatically improved my vocabulary, but not often my ability to understand local native speakers, at least not yet. I usually ask them to repeat slowly. I speak a little, haltingly. Glad to have the app and keep trying. I wish it automatically included the noun's gender when introducing the new word and reinforced noun gender more often in the practices. Fun way to learn."
"Good App, but plenty adverts unless you pay for upgrade, and occasionally hangs/ crashes on my s20. Edit: 100 days in, and generally happy but the app remains a bit glitchy, occasionally doesn't start up/ load correctly. Edit: 180 days in it started being a crashy mess again. Keep having to ""Force Stop"" to get it to load properly. Also, the Americanisms are getting a tad irritating. Wish they did a UK English version!"
"Unfair system, making you buy more. I have been a fan of Duolingo for years now and have made progress on learning different languages. Just recently I have bought my premium. I find it frustrating that the app would freeze on me from time to time. Especially during the time I have a Double XP on. After finishing a lesson, specifically during the listening game. I did it twice and have froze on calculating."
"Was enjoying it but something has changed recently. When you run out of hearts and practice to earn hearts, the exercises used to be varied and random. For the past few days it's been just largely the same phrases over and over again!!! I used to find it helpful to have to revisit long forgotten lessons but it's got too repetitive now. Please fix this as soon as possible."
"The English translations are just odd and don't make a lot of sense. The rewards also disappear when you move them into the shop. I'm still quite fond of the old design, it was way more user friendly, now everything's confusing. Still a good tool to practice you languages, but not a learning tool whatsoever."
Ok so this app is great for learning languages. But there is a certain limit to some things. For example the way they promote super duolingo I like they are promoting health awareness. Literally!!!! The amount of ads based on super duolingo is mad.....and the fact that this is a learning platform makes it even worse. After every single lesson there is a ad based on super duolingo. And I personally think that before teaching basic verbs there should be a teaching lesson.
"1. No rules and errors are explained - think for yourself why there is an error here. Extremely infuriates. 2. No drag&drop on Android (but available on iOS). Extremely annoying. 3. Wrong hints - use it and lose your hearts. 4. Animation is good, but excessive and too long, impossible to skip. 5. Sometimes they disable hints on keyboard (predictive text input). Without any explanation."
"Overall, the app is great! My only complaint, so far, is the font they use is confusing, at times. The capital ""I"" looks the same as the lower case ""l"" (just like right here). When I'm trying to learn words I don't know and they switch between upper case and lower case letters, I can't tell if they're using the i/I or the l/L, causing me to answer incorrectly."
"There are a lot of glitches with streaks and the freezes for them, but the app is easy to use and enjoyable except for that. Edit, I'd also like it if I could undo leaderboard league ""fixes"" or at least that there was a check in there. I'm the kind of person who doesn't like leaderboards to begin with and now I'm out 2,000 gems."
"Sadly I have not enjoyed the latest updates that have been rolled out. Specifically, I am finding the themed units (like ""tell spooky stories"" etc) to be repetitive and less useful than the seemingly more grammar-driven track I was on before. Since the update I also keep getting introduced to vocab I already know as if it's new! And the ""weak words"" personalized practice keeps giving me the exact same six words, which is super annoying and boring. Idk what happened but it used to be much better!"
"Seems like it would be useful if you are going into a language with zero experience, but I had a lot of Spanish in school, my vocabulary is poor, but my grammar is good. I'm stuck going through early portions, they have a way to skip ahead, but it requires you to write sentences with difficult vocabulary, so I'll go through most of the test with zero mistakes, and then fail at the last few questions because they use a word I don't remember"
It's a really good way to step into another language. I like the pronunciation practice element as it helps to build your confidence in this new language. The app does have errors in my case in Mandarin a question may contain the correct Hanzi character but the wrong pinyin while the audio says the hanzi. If you know the hanzi you can complete the task without getting it wrong but especially in a timed challenge it can be annoying. That being said it is a good language learning app.
"Cool app to practice some language skills and build basic confidence. I wish I could rate it higher, but at this point the app is more a mobile game rather than a language learning assistant. I really miss some features like: - Ability to build your own dictionary. Ideally with integration for adding new words to the list - More explicit topics for theory and practice - ""Forgetting curve"" reflection to optimize the learning process - I also really want to see the Serbian language in the list"
"I think I really did learn a lot. it's not much yet and I would love to keep going, but I can form basic sentences in my chosen language now. the characters and style of the app is adorable. premium is cheap, it genuinely works, and having a long streak is cool too. you get rewards and can have friends. definitely recommend for anyone. perfect for first timers and people with some experiences, to anyone like just wanting to touch up your speaking or spelling in a language. 💞"
"The web interface and Android app should match, but they always show different quests. The Android app often freezes when opened the first time on a day, and has to be closed and reopened. The Spanish course should allow you to try lessons from different groups within a unit in whatever order you choose, but instead it forces you to go in a specific order."
"Updated review: There needs to be a confirmation box for timer boosts. When doing a timed exercise, I keep buying timer boosts my mistake because it's right in the spot where I'm typing. I'd like to cancel, but there's no option. It's causing me to lose blue gems. I don't like that. Great app. We need Wolof. I do wish there was a way to send messages to followers and more that we could use the blue jewels on. 👍🏻👍🏼👍🏽👍🏾"
"Gamifying language learning is the best way to get someone to commit, return, and create a habit. While it doesn't contain all the things needed to fully learn a language, it's a great tool to have offered for free. Also, the widget tends to bug out and not update, making me lose my streak, which frustrates me. The widget is why I left this at 4 stars, with other minor nitpicks."
"Removing stars as they remove features... When the hell is Music coming to Android?? I'm about to drop this down to 3 stars... The most recent update changed it so Personalized Practice has the same icon as normal lessons now and that's just awful. It was fine before but now it looks and feels worse. It makes lessons look overwhelming with no breaks at a glance and it's hard to tell where each lesson is when you're reviewing. More bad updates, going down to 3 stars. 2 if this keeps up..."
"I'm already bilingual, and decided to learn a third language while practicing my second language. It offers a great balance for new learners and the ability to jump ahead to your current skill level. I seriously appreciate the pace. I do wish there was a French Canadian option since spoken French is different between the two but hopefully at a later date."
"The app presence and supporting characters are cute. I like the options to redo errors. The spatial repetition with streak freezes give good motivation. Only con is when I tapped on the Welsh words (the language I chose) it immediately shows the English equivalent in the Dropbox below the words. To me, that's like giving away the answer. If the learner can see the answer, there's no point in saying it afterwards. Remove this feature only, then it'll be a mighty fine program."
It's a good starter app. I do think it sometimes stays on the same few words a bit too long for me. It can give a false sense of progression if you are only reusing the same words because you'll think you memorized it now but it was obvious: you'll forget it (or mix it up) at a later time). I wish it learned to move on and return older words if you forgot it much later like Anki. Also wish I could disable the voice over on pressed words in same language voice to text quizzes for harder exposure.
"Love this app. Forgivable manipulation and gamification at its best. Learned so much! But on my 20 day streak in Chinese, suddenly, 80% of the course content changed. I was demoted half a unit, and I'm told I've completed lessons for words I've never learned. I don't know who's daft idea it was to move the goal posts so far without a heads-up, but it's a jarring experience and makes me nervous to continue investing time in it. Better write down all the stuff I can remember so I don't lose it!"
"I think it's a great learning tool with multiple ways of picking up or refreshing a language. Two downsides that keep me from giving it a 5-star rating: the speaking feature never works on my phone (may be an Android thing), so I am unable to practice speaking, and I really don't appreciate that all the scenario stories have to be so woke."
"practice practice practice, makes perfect. The balance of listening, reading, writing, and speaking in each lesson makes this app more than worth it. The reward system, daily, friend, and monthly challenges keep you highly engaged and motivated. Before you know it, you have a good grasp of the language no matter your level. I really do enjoy the app."
"The app is really well made. I personally picked German to learn and the category of learning EDUCATION. It was having almost the same format of teaching as another language for which I had formal education. This goes to show how legitimate the app is. Though I am quite annoyed of the ads, I will not spend any kind of money on an app. But it is really nice that one can get the premium version for free by progressing (though occasionally)."
"Not great for conversational language learning. I don't really need to know how to say ""The crocodiles sent an email and built a sand castle..."" or whatever. I wish it spent more time explaining the grammar and how to be conversational. Teach me how to order food or ask for directions etc. It also sucks that you can't learn specific countries' versions of Spanish eg Puerto Rico, or Cuba, etc....because they're definitely pretty different from Spain Spanish."
"Had a basic understanding of Spanish like he, she, hello and goodbye. The first few lessons were a breeze and it builds up your understanding slowly and definitely if you start at the beginning. It uses many different teaching techniques through the lessons so you get a good grip of how the language works. Pictures, sentences, fill in the blank, multiple choice. The best free app I've found. Also has other languages than Spanish! I get the same satisfaction as if I'm playing a mobile game. 5⭐"
"Hey everyone, I just wanted to share my experience with Duolingo. Unfortunately I was charged with 56€ on accident , I had a really frustrating time using their app. Not only did I encounter technical issues, but their customer support was unhelpful and didn't provide any solutions. It's disappointing when a language learning platform that promises so much falls short in delivering a quality experience. I hope they can improve their services in the future or atleast offer a different plan."
It's a decent app when you're just starting out. Mostly it's memorizing phrases and words. I don't love that you have to guess and do some deductive reasoning to figure out the grammar rules. It would be nice if there was a short grammar explanation for some of the lessons. I get a lot of lessons done perfectly because I have a great short term memory but I'm not sure how much this will help in the long run.
Removing the user comments was a huge mistake. They provided explanations and examples to correct mistakes. The app no longer does that leaving you with no meaningful way to understand your mistakes or improve. There is now no feedback to help you improve. Every update and change seems to make Duolingo worse. Duolingo was much better a few years ago.
"Changed the way to navigate. Chngd 4st 30 days using the app and really like how it made me want to practice. Of course still requires the student to take notes in order to remember vocabulary and caracters. 100+ days using the app: The layout of the lessons changed in a harder to review order. Before, I could see many lessons and their title in a quick glance. Now, the lessons are in buttons almost like in a candy crush game. Much harder to go back and forth when looking for previous lessons."
"Easy to use, and easy to fit into a busy life - you can do as much or as little as you want - and I'm slowly making progress in a new language. It can be a bit temperamental on speaking exercises. I'm also using it for a language I'd started learning previously, and I'm finding it not as useful for that as I'm not really learning anything new yet. I love the French podcast that is available too."
"Loved this app since it's early day and it keeps improving for the better. It would be nice for native speakers to sharpen up on their own language like English person learning English. Loving the math and music on iOS and excited for it to move across all platforms as well looking forward to future lessons. Also, to the developers, I really admire how you take your time to refine everything you bring out before adding additional languages etc 😊💕"
"The app takes language acquisition from all directions- including speaking, writing and memorization. the characters are cute, microlearning is simple and fits easily into your day. I took 2 years of French in high school and I'm able to leverage that and refresh my memory while learning new things as well. My entire family uses this and we all love it."
"It is very good and I love a competition to get up in the league. but I don't rate 5 stars because sometimes I can't hear the small letters in a sentence but you just need to slow it down and you'll be fine. And it's kinda annoying how you have to use double xp on the next 15 minutes, I wish you could save them for whenever."
"I've used this app since 2018 which makes me feel old. It's incredible though and I'm currently studying Esperanto which is a constructed language that was meant to be used for diplomats, and as a secondary language to help in international communication. If you have a basic understanding of the European romance languages I'd most definitely look into it as it is a mesh of several."
"After the update today, the app is weird. It would spin 360 degree whenever I clicked from elsewhere back to home. It's making me dizzy... No vocabulary list, difficult to learn Indonesian with no word list. Not easy to learn korean also, app more suitable for european languages. Also, the app is buggy. I was supposed to get 2x points but often when I checked the total, i only got 1x the points. Does not correctly assign the rewards (gems and points) for having completed the quests and lessons."
"Update 02/07/23 Terrible delays, over 1 minute waiting before the exercise AND after. As I see it, Duolingo consists of two parts: language learning and challenges. For learning you don't need anything: no diamonds, time boosts, nothing. All paid features do not help learning any better or easier but they help with challenges and points. But while learning part is pretty good, the other part with challenges, earning xp points etc is very bad. So, ignore paid features and your ranking."
"Some days I love Duolingo. Then I remember that it's teaching relies heavily on a learner failing and I get demotivated. I'm British learning French but Duolingo forces American English on me, with sentences that are completely alien. There's a tool to report the anomalies but your efforts to report them are completely ignored. So I'm on the fence. Can I recommend it? If you like the brutality of motivation through demotivating then yes. Otherwise, stick to the free version and keep sane!"
"I got the option to try super duolingo, and it said I would be notified before the trial ended and I would be billed, I wanted to cancel before that as I don't need the super version. However, I was never notified and was just billed, I tried getting a refund through Google immediately, but no luck so far, so I'm requesting a refund here now."
"Cute animation, although I wish Duolingo has put more effort into the content. I have paid for the full year of Ukrainian, but ran out of lessons in just one month. Poor selection of words and phrases, teaching me words that are the same in every language: file, Skype, business, jazz, and names such as Linda and Mark - over and over again. Ad nauseam! Emphasis is on the wrong syllable most of the time and no intonation whatsoever. No way to look up an antonym to a word. Sorry, do not recommend."
"Its still good, however, one of the later choices has seriously diminished the experience. They ""simplified"" the lesson plan, letting you no longer choose which lessons you want to take and in what order. Instead youre forced to do exactly their path. This often forces me to do lessons in topics im already strong at, leading to a feeling that I am wasting my time, which made me stop using the app. I recommend one of its competitors, like babbel or coursera instead."
"Duolingo is a good vocabulary trainer, although it doesn't teach a lot of grammar and leaves you rather lost if you don't use supplementary material. However, I disagree with their decision to lay off linguist contractors in favor of AI, and so my rating is one star. Books at the library will do a better job of teaching real grammar, anyhow, and nothing beats speaking to someone who's native language is that which you're learning."
"Ain't that good. I'll be honest here because I've subscribed to the full-year paid version called ""Cringey Super Duolingo,"" and there are no additional features or something that could really help you improve your grammar. There aren't any AI or other features like what ""ELSA Speak"" offers. I really don't recommend this app to anyone who wants to learn seriously and dedicate themselves to a specific language. It's just for LAZY PEOPLE, and the PAID USERS also know that real bad. (Just dig on YT)"
"Huge cash grab. You cannot learn correctly and efficiently unless you pay for the super duolingo subscription. Plus the hilariously repetitive ads make me want to shoot my phone. Also they're very clearly using AI as a crutch, but its not as smart as it ""thinks"" it is. The app will keep getting you to practice your ""weakest words"" when in reality they are simple words I've understood and haven't made an error on at all."
"love this app so much; totally addictive and fun. Having a hard time with conjugating, please add tables for past present and future; to see it all together helps a ton. Also, could you please add a list of all of the vocabulary for/from each section, and please maybe add more exercises where we have to type the answer in different ways, helps to engrain in the brain. Please add more tips and explanations of why and how to do things. Love all the ways it teaches you! Stellar app so far!❤️"
"I started using this application to improve my Japanese listening skills. At some point, the audio starts teaching the wrong pronounciation, it got to a point every day I ask my Japanese wife if the audio I is correct or wrong. And I started worrying about practice which make permanent of mistakes. There is a report button, but no response for your feedback, and when no way of indicating if it's the sentence or the words (sometimes audio mismatch)."
"Great language learning app overall! Just one small bug I really hope gets fixed: After viewing another user's profile page, pressing the ""back"" button on the top corner of the screen will make your entire screen, I kid you not, SPIN and then your previous screen pops up. This clearly wasn't intended, so please try to fix it as it is quite annoying. I am on an Android device. Thank you so much!"
"Great idea to gamify language learning. Frustrated with changes they make to the app without considering ramifications entirely though. Have also been hearing for over a year about their adding music lessons, and I'd love that, but so far nothing. It's inexpensive though, and I find the annual fee worth the money to eliminate ads."
"App is buggy. Pressing near an answer will select wherever the app can reasonably reject a correct answer, to try and hawk the paid version. No easily accessible way to extend streaks or purchase streak freezes, as the store controls were eliminated in the previous update. Used to love this app, but it's all just a cash grab now. *Edit* has only gotten worse, ads now show up whenever time is important, forcing purchases. Absolutely abysmal. Something so good traded for greed. :("
"That new achievement was never available on all phones, the updates I done on the app have not really done anything, there was supposed to be updates on the badge system and nothing, when I do missions there's times it doesn't even count and have to do it again. Lots of users are going up the ranks in the tournament in a matter of seconds. I send multiple emails on this to Duolingo and feels like I'm just getting ignored. I got super Duoligo and feels like a big waste of money and time. 👎🏻"
"great for learning vocabulary, but the ""game"" design is very boring and poorly executed. gems have no purpose, and once you have achieved the top league once, there is no point to keep competing in the weekly ladders. once you've ""beaten the game"" you're just in it to maintain your streak, at which point it doesn't matter how much you practice. the quests and currency need to be better fleshed out, and there need to be more rewards. streak freezes and 2x xp just don't cut it."
"I used to absolutely love this app...not so much now though. As others have said, it does not really cover structure or rules of grammar that would help you to learn better. Also, the older format was ALOT better. I do not like the new format at all. It makes it much harder to earn points for the league and has a lot of woke agendas thrown in...forget politics just help me learn!!!"
"hello! honestly this app is absolutely outrageous. I can learn every language and the best thing is that you get to repeat the lessons, correct your mistakes and practice! learning new languages is awesome, every single one is easily taught and understood! so I recommend for you to download it and at least try it! you won't regret it!!! thanks!"
"I have really enjoyed using this app and am currently just over a 300 day streak. The only thing I can complain about is that the monthly quest meter doesn't seem to be working properly. I missed January's badge after doing plenty more exercises than it said I did. Now for February, I've been doing 2-3 lessons each day and as of Feb 9, it's showing I've only done 4 quests. I'm not sure what isn't working properly to count my lessons, but I'd appreciate if that could be reviewed and fixed."
"The tasks are good, it helps with all aspects in learning the language, and the tips for the entire section are really helpful. The only thing that makes it really hard is the number of hearts, 5 hearts is a little too less, and maybe 15 hearts would be better. I mean, the higher I go, the harder the units get, my 5 hearts finish up really quickly and I can't reach my goals, I think 15 is reasonable so people can reach their goals a bit quicker."
"Great app to learn language and it is completely free if you can bear through ads. The app gamifies learning process that can make it entertaining. The constant notification can be annoying, but it does force you to learn. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 since I found that it does not detect accent well during the speaking part and penalizes me unnecessarily sometimes."
"It starts great. Pictures to learn the words, builds up sentences etc. The further into it, that goes away, and it just gives you different ways to say things with no reason as to the changes to help you understand. Must admit, I'm lost now, so have lost interest as I know what to say, but no idea of the right way to apply it."
"Generally fun, but they provide no support for bugs and the vocab review feature is basically non existent. After two months of studying Russian, it says I've been introduced to ~400 words. Yet if I use the ""review your words"" feature, it only shows me the same ~10 words. I've completed an entire new section, yet it won't let me review any new words, which is really infuriating. I reported this problem, but of course it's been ignored. I'll revise my rating if this is ever fixed."
"Im slowly learning the language as is the intention, but for some reason every now and then the audio gets wierd. Sometimes its fine, others time the questions change between quiet and loud. I can max my volume and barely hear it, then the next question works fine so it blasts my ears. Its not every day but when it happens it messes with me more than it should."
"Used to be a good app, but they've expanded the engine so much that now it constantly crashes unless you have one of the latest devices. I'm in the top 0.1% of users, but I'm about ready to quit. I have to restart the app after every lesson. Granted, it's free and a good way to become familiar with a language, but it's easy to fall prey to their participation contests. Paying customers have huge advantages. If it works for you, focus on the learning alone. I've been doing Duolingo for 5 years."
"It is free, actuallyteaches you a language, and works with any schedule. I like that it has very different types of questions (some are matching words to pictures, some are write what you hear, some are translate this phrase, fill in the blanks, speak the phrase... and more). And each tiny lesson mixes the types of questions so that it doesn't get boring. To me it feels like a game, but to my husband it feels like homework; so while I absolutely love Duolingo, it isn't for everyone."
"I love the app, everything is excellent except there isn't any explanation of grammer in the context it's being used and why. So if you make a mistake it basically won't tell you what the proper word is and what it is that makes it proper. This makes basic gendered words in dutch a nightmare to learn without lots of trial and error."
"Wish there was a setting that would allow me to turn off the writing exercises. My ability to even spell words in my own language kind of sucks, I feel like the writing is holding me back from learning another language. Please developers add a way to turn off the writing exercises if the user desires too. Wouldn't think that could be too difficult."
"Really like the app and I feel like I'm learning quite abit of Spanish... what I don't really like is how long I have to wait to get 5 hearts again when not using the paid version, but you can use the practice option to gain hearts which is a great feature. Also, there used to a chat/comment option for each phrase and each lesson. Sometimes it can get confusing and there are sometimes more than one way to translate something. I thought it was useful to talk with other users about it."
"Love the app. You can learn at your own pace. There are goals to achieve at a steady pace to keep you from over saturating the learning. It keeps a record of what you are stuggling with, which makes it more personalised. I also love the leader board, which keeps you motivated to keep going. If you have been putting off learning a lesson, this is a great way to begin that journey! I would give 10 stars if it was available."
"In this app's early years, it was focused on learning, with stories to practice and many tries at multiple tiered challenges. Now, those same challenges as Rapid review have been sliced up, locked behind extremely fast timers that mostly push you to buy Super or gems to proceed. Leagues were added that pressure you to memorize only parts of words to efficiently make sentences, gain XP, and reach Diamond, seriously damaging your retention of words. Other apps are more thorough and less gamified"
"The Duo app is very engaging and easy to use with bite-sized lessons. Your quests depend on how much time you spend on the app,so it's never too difficult to finish. And you can learn multiple languages at once. However,some African languages on here would be nice too. As well as lessons on interchangeable words (such as using proper prepositions with expressions)"
"I really enjoy this app. The exercises cover listening, speaking, reading and writing in your chosen study-language. The tasks are short and varied with many different voices used to speak in their 1st language, to help you assimilate the reality of the language. You are encouraged to repeat and correct, the activities that you made mistakes in. The app tracks common errors that you make in both spelling and punctuation of your selected new language."
"I've had Duolingo for a few years now. Unfortunately, I lost all my phone data and, with it, the password to get in. Their system does not work properly. I've tried to reach out to Duolingo countless times, and no one has helped me. I paid a subscription, and I can not even use it. I requested a refund, denied. Worst customer service. I wish they cared for the app users much more."
"Not perfect but still very helpful. Harder levels should get harder though but doesn't really, at least first levels in German. Still great! EDIT: Changed my rating to 3 stars since the annoying video ad popup. This is an excellent app and this just spoils the whole experience. No I'm not a paying member but if I had the funds I would gladly do so. I'm sorry."
"The Avatar should not be the only option for a profile photo. I don't like the look of the avatars, and just prefer having an actual photo. Make it an option for people to choose between one or the other. I've also noticed that the Android version of the app is less responsive then the iOS version. I have a newer phone that works well with most other apps, so I know my phone model is not the issue."
"I have been using new layout for some time now and I must say it is a serious step back. Endless scrolling between units, not being able to easily choose the subject I want to repeat, not able to easily choose a story I like, really helpful explanations replaced with a guidebook that now shows only key phrases (at least in the Turkish course)... theis list of DOWNgrades goes on and on... And suddenly my legend-status course has like 10 units degraded and requires TONS of diamonds to reinstate"
"Update: Crashes when opened now. I hardly want to do it daily anymore, it is so tedious. Every time there is a major update and ""restructure"" the ""paths,"" I get a bunch of stuff I haven't actually learned yet. I'm just expected to know it. What? The point is for this app to teach me a new language well, it fails. Often, the sentence structure is so off, it makes no sense to a native English speaker learning a new language. Just put the English sentence in the same structure as what I'm learning."
"I love duolingo! It covers a variety of scenarios and a variety of teaching methods (listening practice, writing, and speaking). And it has several incentives to keep learning, such as league rankings, earning points you can use, and the ability to build a streak if you practice religiously. You can follow your friends and have the ability to congratulate or nudge someone along to encourage their progress, and even participate in friends ""quests"" to earn badges etc. Its 👍"
"So pleased to see you have reinstated the learning grammar notes for each topic/level. Much more helpful again thank you! However all my legendary levels have disappeared this and the trail is completely different! What has happened? Love this app but would like my legendary levels reinstated please. (I've now abandoned doing legendary levels, I've had them removed once before and won't risk it a third time.)"
"It helps me because i tend to race through without paying attention to everything. The constant repetition makes me aware to what i am not paying attention. It makes me listen, read, write. I have tried other apps. This format is the best for Korean because the sounds and characters are so similar. You are not learning conversational Korean just to get by. You are learning to write, read the letters and to understand the differences in how we make sounds."
The best language app I've ever tried but I can't give 5 stars because the speaking exercises don't work. I turned on the microphone and gave all the permissions but it still doesn't help. I really lack pinyin in guidebook section. The characters are not helpful for me to write the phrases and read them to remember better. And one more feature that would make this app perfect is flashcards tool. That would be so much helpful to make the words memorizing and reviewing easier.
I like Duolingo a lot it helps with learning new languages but while making you feel like it's a game. Duolingo finds fun and challenging ways to help you with the language you are trying to learn. It also reviews any mistakes you made throughout the lesson you are on. The only thing I have against is how they word things the way they word things quite challenging to figure out I was stuck on a lesson because they expected me to know that I needed to split up the word. Overall I like Duolingo.
"It's a really good app. I hope they can diversify the Vietnamese program they have. They only focus on the Northern accent. If they could split it between North and South, that would be helpful. I also think there should be more speaking practice opportunities to really target pronunciation in a language with such intricate phonology. As a Korean learner of 10 years, I must say the Korean program is extremely difficult and needs improvement."
"Great app for learning foreign languages and has lots of fun and varied learning techniques, like stories and speaking experiences (unfortunately theys aren't available on certain languages). The only problem is that it doesn't focus on grammar much so you probably couldn't learn to speak a language fluently just using Duolingo. But overall it is a great app!"
"There are no options on the app to point out errors. Most of which are only the mispronounciation by the automated voices. Also, some of the story lines are not necessarily appealing to a general audience. Too many repititions become tedious. Some sentences are humourous but so unrealistic as they will never be used in any context. However, the app is a very helpful tool and somewhat addictive. But it is best used with other learning material. Some explanations of grammatical points are missing."
"I really wish I could give this app more stars. I like the lessons and how interactive and applicable they are, but the app frequently doesn't register when I've completed a lesson at all, even if I close the app or sign out, which makes it impossible to progress. It's very frustrating, especially when it happens on a Legendary level."
"Been using it for a year now, pretty good app apart from the new update that made all profile pictures have an ""avatar"" instead of a picture. Doesn't let you change back to a picture/image file even if you go on the website instead of the app. I personally don't like this update, I don't want to display how I look, I want to show pictures of my cat etc"
"Excellent resource for the self-motivated learner. If you actively wish to learn a new language, you can really make this app work for you if you take it upon yourself to make it a rule that you speak out loud to the best of you ability at every opportunity, as the app is not able to focus on spoken exercises. In leu of this, I really wish there were auditory-only exercises that forced you to listen to a sentence in the foreign language, which you then have to type out the translation of."
"Here's my review for Duolingo: In my experience with using it I have found it to be quite a useful app. First impressions were five stars and it is still true. Very easy to use, good interface. And the characters are really fun. And no you will not be attacked by Duolingo like the Internet says. I am currently learning German and I can now pronounce many sentences. Great app!"
"Single units have become ridiculously long, with 20+ exercises. Also, IOS has always had many more kinds of exercises compared to Android. Maybe after a couple of years it would also be time to expand Android's questions and whatnot? It is so boring to do always the same 3 exercises and sentences, repeated over and over. Not a very effective way of learning."
"It used to feel like the app was earnestly trying to teach you a language, but after recent updates I feel like they're just trying to run down my hearts with repetitive, boring lessons. I stopped learning and now just repeat the same 3 sentences in different variations. Losing hearts because I'm bored and not paying, not because I don't know the answer..."
"I really love Duolingo, it makes learning a new language fun, easier and quicker. I like the streak system, the different modes of learning (writing, listening, selecting). I love how there's also an option to select 'Can't listen right now'. I feel like Duolingo in a sense has revolutionised the speed & learning languages. The challenges, leaderboard, badges and quests keeps engagement and a sense of healthy competition. I've learnt so much in so little time & felt so accomplished!"
"Honestly, this app is great and I have been trying to learn Arabic since its my original language in my free time. But I decided to switch to Korean, since I wanted to learn too. I closed the app and came back in a bit, and I came across this bug that wouldn't let me open duolingo... I try to open duolingo, but it just closes the app. I tried to delete duolingo and redownload. It worked for a bit, but the bug came back. Hopefully this bug gets fixed :D"
"你好! I'm learning mandarin! The only gripe I have is that if the course content changes, IE: Unit 2 now talks about music and lawyers, and you go back to do the review tests for the stars, it does not bridge the gap by introducing the new words. It just expects you to know them. At higher level, it is riddled with people that auto complete lessons for leaderboards. Why though.... I would love to help the developers prevent this."
Love the learning experience and the lessons are really good at teaching vocabulary and entering into long term memory. It has boosted my confidence in speaking a different language to native speakers. Only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is because the match madness exercises are purely made to make money off the user. It's virtually impossible to complete a level 2 or 3 match madness without purchasing a row blaster or a time extension. Everything else is fantastic!
Very engaging. I am quite impressed. Using Spanish for over a month now and I have a decent base of knowledge. Occassionally will give you a reason why a certain format of a word is used versus another. I'm usually pretty accurate but if I know the philosophy behind it I will understand and learn it better. There have been once or thrice I felt it was incorrect and a few times it already had the answer selected and you couldn't click and other small glitches. A little intro would be nice too.
"This app while useful is so buggy that it is frustrating. The amount of times you say things correctly and it flags as incorrect is incredible. To a point that during some of the talking exercises I feel like giving up. The leagues are pointless, people shouldn't feel guilty because they haven't managed to find time to use the app on any particular day. This app would be loads better with a ""conversational"" setting, I'm not going to be talking about a butterfly writing a book at any point."
"Great app however alot of the writing requires you to translate a sentence from eg Spanish to english instead of the opposite which would be just as if not more beneficial for learning a language. Also the notes for each level don't have a lot of explanation for why they use or change the form of something etc. Instead it's very basic & that could easily be expanded eg a table showing how a word changes form. Aside from those, really great app and highly recommend-my Spanish has improved hugely!"
Excellent app. Very easy to work with and easy level of understanding. You can learn at your own time and your own pace whenever and wherever you want. You can even set reminders to your daily lessons so that you don't miss the change of increasing your vocabulary everyday and you not only learn your to pronouns them but how to spell them. This app is great for language learning for all age group and it's highly rewarding.
"Duolingo is a very effective and engaging learning aid when used in conjunction with separate learning resources. It is a useful tool for getting to grips with pronunciation and spelling, but perhaps falls a little short on explaining grammar concepts in my experience. Would still recommend for anybody new to or even experienced in learning a second language."
"Very disappointing for a paid service. I miss the message boards that allowed learners to interact and learn more about a topic. App will frequently be glitchy and not register that I played on a day forcing me to use a ""streak freeze"". The devs keep updating the leaderboard/ app and not really saying anything to the users (just ""surprise!""). I want to pay for another year, but their inconsistencies are pushing me away."
"The app is undeniably good. When learning languages, it takes you through the very basics, repeating the material so many times that you easily perceive and remember it. As a result, you begin to understand native speakers, compose quite complex sentences and express your thoughts professionally. There are also a large number of quality courses to choose from. Thanks to the Duo team 💚💚💚"
"This is a good app that makes learning a language fun, and I feel I have come on quite far in the six months I have been using it. My major criticism centres around glitching points system. It says I will get double points then doesn't give them, or says I will get higher points on a level up but just gives regular points. And I have recently discovered that my friend who has the app on her iPad gets more than double the points I can for the same lesson. 😤 Not fair when we compete in leagues."
"I take back my word on saying it's a good app and instead of the former 4 stars, I'm giving it 1 star, I'd have given 0 star if it were possible. Even after updating it repeatedly, it keeps telling me I'm offline and as if that's not bad enough, it keeps closing repeatedly whenever I'm in the middle of a class and I can't reopen it no matter how many times I try. This is really disappointing. This is not the Duolingo I know and grew to love."
"Can they fix pronunciation error once and for all? How is it possible that the male and female voices say the same word with accents/stress on different syllables of the word? How are we supposed to know which one is the correct way? Also, it is extremely frustrating when the app faults you for an answer if you don't include article ""a"" in English. Yet the app is allowed to make plural vs singular errors no problem..."
"App is good at teaching you a language at a very basic level. If you want any advanced learning without interruptions, you need to pay but even then the developers over the years have made sure to notify you at every possible instance to make you pay them even with subscription. Every exercise is aimed at making you spend as much app time as possible while promoting you to pay for stuff to reduce frustrations while learning. App has been around for several years but still has plenty errors."
"I'm just learning spanish for fun, but it's very cool to fo with this app. only one thing i noticed: when you need to translate a sentence from English to Spanish, you can't tell if the ""you"" is singular or plural, so would be great if you did some kind of markers to make it clearer! edit: also would love to have the option to turn off the vibration!"
"Duolingo is a very effective app in learning new and multiple languages. It helped me to learn new words, I will say is 100% good the reason for my 5 star, but I will like to enjoy more of free premium learning. But I will advise especially in German course where one have from A1 - C2 level, if each of the level will be differentiated it will help alot especially to the beginners. So they won't be scared because of the grammatical structures, aside that, is good to go."
"For the most part it's okay. I never had any issues up until yesterday/today when I noticed that with some of the Spanish exercises they are blatantly pronouncing the INCORRECT answer. Thought it was me at first, had to hit ""repeat"" multiple times just to be sure. Holding the speaker right next to my ear and listening at slower speeds is when I confirmed that it was in fact the wrong answer being pronounced."
"Generally good app for learning, I've been using it for 2+ years. But I have daily frustrations. I'm using Android, Ipad, browser, all 3 are vastly different experiences. Feels like they don't care abt providing a consistent experience. ie: dbl XP gift for Friend Quest challenge & will just disappear on the website. & seems like translations are AI generated, which doesnt work for cultural translations. I'm constantly reporting errors, which feels like I'm doing their job"
"it's a very nice app and a must recommend for those wishing to learn any language. However, there are times I find it difficult to access the app despity data being on. I'd suggest that a refresh function key be incorporated into the app. That way, one can refresh the app in cases of network glitch. Besides that, the app is all good."
"This is a decent app to learn a couple of semesters; however, it is lacking. This app shows you new words that you are tasked to memorize, and then it throws phases/sentences at you to memorize. The problem is that it never gives you what I would call a lesson. It never just tells you what the rules of the language are or the grammar. You have to figure these details out from the sentences you have to memorize. This is okay in the beginning, but it gets to a point where I find it untenable."
"Fun way to learn, recommended. It's more challenging in the free version, but you can definitely use this app to practice for a new language you may be learning. Explains basic pronunciation and writing skills, but not much information about grammar. But for using the app for just 2 weeks I can recognize some dialogs in real life and words sound more familiar. Give it a try!"
"Beware of super charges. I tried the super option and really like it! It really is helpful practicing every day. When I signed up for the trial it advertised it as $6.99 a mo. When the day for the trial ended I really did think that the app ad free was worth $6.99 so I didn't cancel, however it charged me $90 for an entire year. I would give 5 stars if there was better payment options. Being charged all up front sucks I would much rather pay a monthly subscription."
"I love this app! I'm learning Italian, and I find it very engaging; you can have friends, weekly challenges, daily & monthly quests, badges etc able to go back and revise previous sections... The coding guys have a kinda quirky sense of humour that they bring out through the various characters in the lessons. Then there are these passive-aggressive reminders that they send as notifications... lol! Generally, it's a really good app for anyone who wants to learn any language from scratch!"
"it is fantastic for practice. However, often it seems to glitch back in time to repeating old stuff you are well beyond. Additionally, new learning or grammar and word or sentence construction is very badly explained, or not at all. I have extra lessons, research and books to supplement the learning, and use duo for daily revision"
"this is an amazing app, gamification, motivation, good content. But I'm giving this a 2 start instead of 5 because of one single issue that totally breaks the system: You get double XP for a review (with always the same questions) vs normal courses that take double the time and only give half the XP, resulting in you only doing reviews if you quickly want to be on top of leaderboard. it should be the opposite or at least the same XP, or even better, time based XP!"
Update 3/29/24 Really don't like the new update! Things are pretty good for the moment but there are some issues that usually arise when an update rolls around. It usually gets fixed after a couple weeks but that can be annoying. All in all I am learning alot in Spanish but when I go to other languages it is too tough for me to understand without any basic understanding of letters/characters and sentence structure. Maybe one day I'll try to figure them out but for now I love learning spanish.
"It's UI is nice and easy to understand, and I'm sue It's great for someone just visiting a country for a week, but as someone who wants to gain a a fundemental understanding of the language it just isn't for me. It meerly teaches you words and sentences rather than grammar and word structure. Good luck learning words on your own, because it does not give you the tools to do so. For anyone who's wondering, I've been learning German on an 11 day streak with around 20 lessons complete."
Amazing!! I've learnt so much and Duolingo makes me motivated to keep going. Would definitely recommend it and wether you're using it for school or work or just for fun it is a fantastic online teacher. My friend had it and recommended it and it has changed my life. I am doing a language to help communicate with family and thanks to this app I can finally understand them. I hope you get this app and enjoy learning the language of your choice. Bye
"I'm learning Japanese. However, ""Practice your words"" doesn't work and neither do ""speaking exercises"". What's the point of paying when features don't work. 😑 They don't even work on the PC. It's nice for encouragement and practice. But not learning in a proper way. Like it doesn't state which its formal or not to say something. I want to like it because of the easy interface, but it's ok for in-between lessons."
"great ap. it would be better if there was much more talking to the microphone segment and some AI integration for conversation. great ap but could be better. I also would prefer if you could chose to opt out of the written segments. personally I only have interest in learning to converse in other languages, I'm not interested in learning the written parts but they seem embed into the rest of the lesson progressions. change this to get an extra star :p"
"Fun lessons and very encouraging. As a native 'British' English speaker I have to filter translations through my understanding of 'American' English though (ON the weekend instead of AT the weekend, for instance) or get marked as wrong. Guess I'm getting lessons in two languages for the price of one there :). Well worth paying for Super Duolingo - I'm making much better progress now I have it. Thanks for the humour, Duo!"
"Useful app to start learning the basics of a language. I like the fact that there are listening, reading, writing, and speaking exercises. There are multiple units for different life contexts. The ads in the free version aren't very annoying, and every once in a while I get awarded Super Duolingo for free for a few days."
I'm multilingual using Duo to learn Korean from scratch. Effective language learning tool if you allow yourself to follow the gaming approach. An improvement would be to allow a separate sound control for the milestone tunes - they are louder than the app speech and embarrassing when using away from home. Have an option to lower the milestone sounds and/or switch them off in away from home mode. Thanks!
"I am totally confused and frustrated by the app. I believe I got through all the lessons and now the app is putting me back through the most basic lessons. I have no idea how the reward system works either. And now the interface has changed again, and I can't do a spell check on my words or add accents. And it keeps telling me I've got spelling mistakes when it is all about the accents! I really don't get this"
"I have really enjoyed learning languages with this app. Our whole family uses it. After this last update I cannot advance in lessons. It starts to load & then I get an error message ""An error occurred. Try again later"". This has been going on for days. It sounds like, from the reviews, a lot of us are having issues after the last update."
"Pretty good, thumbs up, silver star. I did learn a fair bit of Japanese here and learning the characters here is great. Dark mode. My settings doesn't have a dark/light mode to default to so anything will just default to light. Every time I switch the dark mode on it goes back to system default which for me, doesn't exist. So whenever I practice Japanese in the middle of the night I become blinded."
"The web version on PC is honestly better. Let's say you translate a sentence but got two or more words that are directly beside each other in the wrong positions, instead of just being able to drag them to their right positions, you have to remove all the words after the error and re insert them again as opposed to just DRAGGING the wrongly placed words to their right positions which is really convenient on my PC which I don't use as often. It would be really nice if this can be integrated 😇"
"I didn't finish an entire course yet, but i would imagine the app wont teach you very advanced stuff. Although i must say that ive learnt more french in 2 weeks with this, than from my school teachers in 2 years. It makes it easy to start learning a language, though if youre really serious about it you should seek more advanced courses/resources after a while. Some aspects of the ui are not very intuitive, for example i did not realize that gem counter also acts as the shop button."
"I really like this app, it's helping me a lot as an addition to private lessons. The animated characters are amusing. It would be nice if there was an option to hear all of the sentences spoken out loud. the questions that ask you to ""complete the sentence"" for example. It would be good to have a play button on those so that we could hear those spoken out loud as well. If that feature were available, I'd probably rate this a 5."
"There are ads if ur not a premium and the constant race board is also really annoying because I'm just trying to learning sweadish in peace and at my own pace but with the leader board you feel rushed and like you have to constantly do lessons to keep up for getting demoted. But over all I really like duolingo, its helped so much."
"This app has been wonderful. It has made it possible for me to start learning a language I would otherwise never have the chance to learn. My only complaint is that if I get stuck on a lesson and go through my hearts before I get all the way through it, my daily streak will reset even though I've been trying. It has a streak freeze for 2 days, but sometimes I get really stuck on one and it takes me longer to get through. It should count for my daily streak if I'm trying."
"Really doesn't teach you the fundamentals of a language or WHY certain things are the way they are, but it used to do that sometimes! That's my main issue with it! The app seems to keep getting more gameified and worse over time. If I'm learning a language, I need fundamentals before I can even attempt to learn conversation. Also, their use of AI is stupid and embarassing. Pay real translators."
"The stories will sometimes freeze at the end after pressing continue and does not complete the excercise. It doesnt matter if you write a response or not. I will normally start my day reviewing a story. When it doesn't complete, I will let it, run hoping it will finish and give me my points and my afternoon xp boost, but this doesnt always happen. Today I let it process 8 hrs."
"I've had Duolingo almost a year now. While it's very helpful to learn words and some grammar, nothing is explained as to WHY certain grammatical rules are the way they are. Having explanatory tips like that would be very helpful. A for the the match cards, they serve more to stress the user out because of such short timeframes. Instead of leaving an opportunity to properly match the words and put that to memory, users are forced to connect what can be seen as fast as possible."
"good app, would be great, but you need premium to utilize the even basic ""practice lesson courses."" the ones that explain grammar/sentence structure early on. It was a bit difficult due to only having half the information. also getting penalized for mistakes? if you don't get through your lessons in the 5 tries they allow, you don't get to learn. on one hand, it makes you really double down, on the other I'm limited on how much I can study in a givin day. otherwise, I do enjoy doulingo!"
"Not a bad app considering it's free (with limits unless subscribed). I already know some Korean but trying to get to a place where I can have a full on conversation. Only issues are, sometimes the voices that say the words to you are not pronounced clearly. So when you go to repeat it it fails sometimes. Not a big deal."
"Update: There is a critical bug in latest version. It must not be there,very trivial but somehow it is there. Issue 2: There are bugs in time limit check during timed streaks. It ends while about 20+ seconds remain, faced it multiple times. I can record it and provide. Which make me using the app or to subscribe. I am trying Japanese with this app. Some more improvements can be done, but given 4 stars due to good features and look of the application and content. Thanks"
"I'm rating the free version, student budget means free language apps. I enjoy the game style of learning, it keeps me engaged. The variety of voice actors contributing to the recorded lines, paired with unique styles of people representing who I'm talking about also serves to keep me focused on Duolingo. A star is missing mainly because of how thoroughly infested the free version is with premium ads. Every lesson, every review, stops what it's doing so the rainbow owl can promo the premium."
"I would say this app is great at most things but going in brand new and just starting to learn a new language is difficult. It expects you to already know some of the language and mostly focuses on phrases and not the sounding of the words or any symbols in that language. In general, you need prior knowledge to even get far in this app and it doesn't help that you lose hearts if you get something wrong."
"Numerous bugs and quirks detract from the experience. Often when I get a 2x boost as for completing a lesson, it disappears immediately. Since upgrading to Super, the Gems I've been earning are reduced as I can't watch an ad to earn more. There's an option to disable unlimited hearts, but no way to earn them back if you lose them, which makes it all pointless. It's a bizarre situation where you pay for more but get less, and for that reason I will not be renewing my subscription once it expires."
"The random number generator in this app is clearly inadequate. Keeps cycling selected words only, instead of the full set of words. Many sentences are weird and said in a way a human would never do, apparently are generated by a low-quality AI. It is a bit of a shame for the publisher with such a huge user base; those issues are apparently easy to fix, however they are focused mostly on the gamification and retention, rather than actual teaching."
"Whoever the team behind this learning platform, you guys are amazing! At first, I had doubts that the learning method in this app will ever work. However, I was wrong! I started to see the change in less than 40 days! I am now able to read some basic french, I know a lot of words and grammars, I can write some basic French! Once I get a solid grip to French, I'll start moving to Italian or Spanish. Duolingo team, you guys are amazing, thank you for such a learning opportunity!"
"Consistently getting worse and worse over time. 1) Language courses are riddled with incorrect/incomplete or non-sensical translations. 2) No real people are monitoring feedback for the courses. 3) Because of 2) there are no way to express feedback for 1). 4) Artificial delays and unskippable animations are added to waste more of your time on the app. 5) Helpful social features are consistently getting removed to make your experience worse, instead added useless features like avatar constructor."
"Duolingo is generally a great, fun way to learn. However, I had a maddening experience. I was unable to complete a level because the acceptable answer continued to change, as a scene was enacted where a person was asking for more coffee. The question asked where this person was. Bar, restaurant, and cafeteria were each answers at different times. I burned several hearts and gems to complete, yet if I did not guess the correct answer at that given time (with no context), I was wrong. Unacceptable"
"I already use some Spanish on a daily basis. This app rated my knowledge and has started me at an appropriate level. I'm disappointed in the mistakes some of the exercises contain that have caused me to fail two different questions/exercises. They were a problem in the app vocabulary that offer incorrect choices. Overall It's easy to use, and I like the variety of games to give me skills in the critical areas of comprehension."
"Overall, I thoroughly enjoy using Duolingo to learn except one thing. As a Free User, I do not like when I ""Earn a Free Super Duo"" I don't like the interphase. If I had the ability to turn it off completely. I like the practices for Accuracy Repetition and Speed. If Y'all's could pop a Switch in the Profile options (or summut) I would most certainly rate your Lovely application *****. Sincerely. Ryan McKeag."
"I've been using it for years and I've loved it. But some of the new features on here have started to bother me. I dislike how lessons are being taught now, and it has become repetitive and tiresome. I know I am able to skip to the next unit if I've learned enough, but I dislike the feeling of not fully finishing it all. Also I dislike the new avatar profiles, I wish they were optional! I miss my old profile picture with my dog, I didn't think I would be stuck using the avatars..."
"this is actually a really great app! my only problem is the animations. they seem too sensitive. if i leave the app running in the background for too long, all animations and special fx stop working. then i have to go to settings and clear my data, which is an annoying process (i usually have to reset my settings). so, duolingo, can you please fix this problem? it would be greatly appreciated."
"Super great! I was enrolled in a Chinese dual emersion a few years back, and I got Duolingo to help stay on top of it when I moved. It worked wonders, but I was a little disappointed that it didn't teach me how to write new characters. I know that lost languages you learn are not character based, but it would be a nice feature I hope to see in the future. ---UPDATE--- They added the ability to draw Chinese Hanzi! This is a feature that makes studying well worth it."
"Just a suggestion, why don't you add audio on the English words??? its ok, but I'm just saying this could really improve Duolingo for me and I bet for many others too... If this is done I would be really thankful... Otherwise, this is a really awesome app, and I really love the progress I have been able to make on this app. Another thing is that it has the really nice friends and thing where you can friend and follow people, there are also leagues and leaderboards that I love."
"I've been using it for 8 days. I'm loving it so far. Update; 195 days in, lots of bugs suddenly appearing. Errors rarely fixed, have to see them over and over again through the lessons. Progress is very, very slow. Introduce new ideas, words etc without explanation. Have to guess and hope your understanding of it is correct."
"It's great! You get to learn a language. I'm learning Japanese 🍡. They celebrate your progress. and others can too! They put it in the feed. there's a leaderboard so you can rank up! There's tips in the feed every few days. There's cool fun things they do in it as well. Or XP ramp - ups sometimes. You can get a streak, I'm around the 60 streak. I recommend this game 😁🎯"
"It's good if you want to learn some words but it's not very useful if you want to learn grammar and stuff. Of course it can't make you fluent. Also in some languages it goes really fast and you can't catch up with it or the progress is very slow (but this is not much of a problem, you memorize it better). But if your goal is it learn some phrases so you can communicate in another country or you just want to have some fun learning, Duolingo is one of the best apps for this."
"I enjoy doing Duolingo it's just that it doesn't give me animations. also with my friend they actually have an avatar instead of just having a profile picture. When they open their settings to change what they want, back to the animations the only animation that works is why I get the double XP bottle. Also I can't follow people on Duolingo and some achievements that other people for some reason I don't earn the achievement or they don't give me the achievement, it's very annoying."
"Great learning app. covers all modalities of learning and repeats to learn where needed to check understood. its actually made fun too , like a game ... considering languages were never my stong point naturally, I'm doing well and really enjoying all, the speaking, listening and written, it even provides motivational incentives to keep up consistent daily learning and with realistic targets... so it must be a pretty exceptional app if I can do it ;-)... enjoy! x"
"I have been using Duolingo for a while now. It has been a nice experience so far with occasional hiccups. Good job! Inclusive conversation could be extended to include other groups of people with mental and physical conditions, minority culture/traditions like Pacific Islanders, etc. there are many features that can be added on top of same gender relationships, which is the one and only inclusive feature in Duolingo."
"Duolingo is an amazing app in its own type. It's really enjoyable when you learn new languages that much easy. Actually, everything is fine, but the only thing that is annoying a little bit is the lack of some perfect and classical languages like Persian. You can learn fictional language on duolingo, but there is no possibility of learning a REAL and nice language like Persian."
"the streak, leaderboards, powerups add to the gamified feel, and i really like that. it keeps you hooked. i dont really have a problem with the ads, cuz at the end of the day, they gotta earn money. But it feels like their pushing their 'super' subscription too much. Legendary levels, which is essentially free xp, is only available to super users. You have to spend atrocious amounts of gems to get it, and the chests only give you little. 5 hearts aint enough, cuz were *learning* a language!"
"The app needs more work for Scottish. The more you learn the new words, the less you hear the new words. There are several words that won't give an audio, so it makes it hard to pronounce the word when you're reading it. Also, if you click on the Scottish word for fill in the blank, the newer words won't sound out, but the old words from earlier in the app when you started will. Please fix this issue. This language doesn't need to be lost."
"Easy to use. It has a rewards system to make it ""fun"" to learn. However, that reward system mostly rewards speed. This is fine to quickly recognise a spoken language but leaves little to no room for beginners to practise speaking the words and pronouncing them correctly. So if you power through and select answers quickly, you will be rewarded but taking the time to practice speaking words and sentences aloud will cost you rewards. Why would you rush whilst learning a new language?"
"It's great for learning languages but there are tons of bugs that need to get fixed. But The developments won't fix them, in fact they won't look at our rating even though they say leave us a feedback. sometimes the audio won't load or glitches, it also won't load some levels and you'll get stuck and can't learn anything anymore, the free 2 weeks ""Super"" does not work for me and sometimes when you run out of time in the Rapid Review it won't load and you'll lose 100 gems. I lost 300 gems."
"It's a fun way of learning and I really like it, but the only thing that absolutely ticks me off is the people who use Super. It gives an unfair advantage to others and while I keep having to be in the champion things with a BUNCH of people who use it, it just feels absolutely unfair. I think that it would be more fair if we were all in different leagues, people who use Super can go against people who use Super and people who use regular Duolingo can go against people who use the regular version"
"Longtime user first-time reviewer. I used to like Duolingo a lot before it sold its soul to gamify its app for the lowest common denominator. The language progression tree used to feel like an engaging way to learn a language. I used to learn concepts and words quickly. However, with the new language path, it is utterly shocking how little I retain. If you heard that Duolingo is a language-learning app, that's no longer true. It's a game that pretends to teach a language."
"it's a great app many positives but sometimes certain things aren't explained throughly after some practices, I feel it can be a bit fast with learning new words and not repetitive enough with them. I lost a 59 day streak because I got a bit overwhelmed not being able to keep up with new words. Other than that, it's a fun app. They have fun friendly competitions and little fun rewards, and you can meet people."
"It's ok for learning a language, but that's about it. There's nothing outside of the little game it has, and that can be easily optimized to become a glorified match three. The puzzles just aren't engaging or complicated enough to truly force you to learn, and some of the mechanics actively dissuade progression. It's good for daily reminders, but only works as a supplement to more intense classes."
"Honestly, I am not very good at learning languages. So when I looked at this app I was pleasantly surprised. The bright and cheerful way to learn languages appeals to me, and games and stories feels very natural. My only complaint would be the app has ads frequently, (using the duolingo site bypassed them) & the loss of hearts when you get something wrong. I want to learn so I opted for super Duolingo subscription. No longer waiting for refill."
"I am a a bilingual person. I wanted to practice Spanish and thought this app would be perfect. It's not. The app doesn't account for the grammar half the time. It weirdly switches back and forth between grammatically correct translation to a direct translation. It's weird. It'll say ""los pans"" to ""bread."" It's PLURAL in Spanish, and I reporting it doesn't so anything. I regret spending money on it. I wouldn't recommend this app."
"I loved this app. After a few weeks using this for the first time. I'm a new beginner. I noticed that some bugs that need to be fix. The app glitched frequently, for a example, question said ""the girl"" it supposed to answer question and type in ""la Nina"" but I couldn't type it. It give me an errors message. I've reported these glitches. And... There are no grammar tips for helps. Very frustrating. It makes me to unsubscribe duolingo plus edition because of some bugs and glitch. This app is trash"
"I don't like the random words they throw in for you to repeat the correct option without saying what on earth it is . definitely not enough time to go over past learning .it seems v rushed to me . some basic months of the year ,numbers ,days of the week colours etc would be useful. yes I get the sentences right but it's kinda obvious if your English is good.but I don't really know it"
"I want to give Duolingo a better review. I really do! It eases you into topics well and the repetition based learning is legitimately useful. But the Android app is so full of bugs that it's really frustrating. Sometimes the app will claim that you've won an XP boost for finishing a module only for it to never appear, other times your daily score just won't update or will just revert to what it was last time you opened the app. The list goes on. Good for teaching, but frustrating app."
"This app seems pretty great at first, but then you figure out that it's mostly just made to make money. The learning is good, but as it gets harder, it makes you feel way more demotivated to actually learn the language. The ads are 99% of the time for Super duolingo, and in the ad, they say they get rid of the ads, so they are literally just getting rid of the ad for no ads. I think you're just better off learning a language from someone in person who actually speaks the language."
"this is the third time I've picked it up and definitely the time I've been most consistent. I think deleting other attention grabbing apps helped, but engaging with the whole app too is useful, playing the challenges, utilising the earl bird/night owl double XP loop. A suggestion to add to the app would be a verb challenge game in the practice section, where it just gives you variations of all learned verbs, they work, you sleep etc."
"fun characters make it easier to learn - and much more enjoyable! streaks make you want to come back and learn, along with leader boards. I don't have super, but you only get a short add after you complete a lesson, so not as bad you might think. also you only get 5 hearts (so five mistakes) and if you use them up, either you must refill with gems (earned by completing challenges) or wait a few hours before they refill on their own all in all, it's a great - and fun - way to learn!"
"It forces you to use the app daily and try to rank first in every league. its frustrating when I barely have any time, especially playing other games that gets put first by duo. its good motivation but i widh this was just a choice to compete with other people. i would just want to learn the language. either way, it doesn't know much about how to actually speak it. only the textbook versions."
"This is a good app, been using it for over a year. The format and usability are excellent. The introduction of new vocabulary is too slow, about 6 new words a unit, each unit has about 30, 5-8 minute lessons. I do a couple a day, a unit takes me a couple of weeks. 6 words in 2 weeks is not nearly enough, becomes very repetitive. I use DuoCards to learn new words."
"This App no longer works on my phone. I uses my phone data but it doesn't work, all it keeps showing was you are offline. The funny thing is, it's the only app having this experience. Even when I updated the app it doesn't work unless you're connected to a wifi. So I need help so as to continue my learning."
"I think that Duolingo is a great app to learn a language. I think the thing that bugs me is that there isn't enough incentive to put a lot of effort into tournaments as a non-Super user. Yes, you receive more gems, but you rarely get free Super days. Also, they put you up against Super users. Yes, Super users paid for advantages, but having to compete against them is unfair and not reflective of the effort of the learner at all! It would be better if the tournaments were categorized."
"The app used to be great, but I've noticed a decline in sentence quality in several languages since the update. The app crashes frequently, often when I'm mid lesson. It's also not uncommon for me to do one of the practices to earn hearts or watch a video to gain a heart, and then end up getting nothing."
"It's fine, but it doesn't teach grammar properly. Neither does it accept many other options if you translate a sentence. Like, I've lived in Germany for my whole life so I obviously know german grammar. And I sometimes ""learn"" German/English to earn Xp, but it doesn't accept every sentence in german (even though it's completely correct and you can 100% say it that way too). It's really annoying, cause when you learn a language with many different grammar stuff, you should have more options."
"I wish I had more hearts, rarely any ads though there are some. IDK what type of conversation Duolingo thinks people are having but a can successfully say ""car is a spoon"" in French. I downloaded Duo because I'm in a French class and it does help to just review some words. I like that you can review lessons, having a streak is a goal and something that I personally look forward to. I do recommend this app!"
"I enjoy using Duolingo on a daily basis as it is easily accessible and easy to get started. I am learning Norwegian in about 15 - 30 minutes a day. There is repetition of words and phrases in various ways so that I am able to eventually remember more and more vocabulary and sentence sentence structure rules in a natural way. There are ways to include competition with yourself and also with Duolingo ""friends"" to encourage one to continue practicing which leads to improvement. I like how easy is"
"Loved Duolingo....at first....but there's no way to retake each level (only a REVIEW option) so realised that as I would progress further with no way to redo a lesson, I found the first unit really hard towards end, only option I found is to remove the language and start completely over. Was willing to pay for the superduolingo up to that point ☹️"
"I miss the older version. I understand incentivising for a paid version but it prioritises competition over learning. Anyone learning a language understands there are areas where we struggle. The best thing is to practise multiple times until we feel more comfortable. This option is mostly gone in the updated free version. Practising completed sections costs gems. Also, the league system pushes people to do more new lessons instead of reinforcing what's been learnt. Much less is retained now."
"It is a great way to start learning a language. The gamification and streak count keep you motivated. But you can get a perfect score without actually learning the vocabulary, especially in later lessons. The platform could benefit from flashcards and passive listening practices where you don't have to be looking at the phone."
App is great for staying consistent with language learning. I just wanna say that they added a new feature recently where you can refill your xp boost for 100 gems. Neat. But I wish there was a confirmation before purchasing. I was almost done my lessons for the moment but I accidentally hit the purchase button while rushing through lessons. A waste of 100 hard earned gems that could've been easily prevented
"Taking the Hindi course, answers are often incorrect and the app punishes you by preventing you from continuing lessons after you make mistakes. The course is also way too short: after two sections and barely a couple months, the app runs out of new material to teach, after hardly having even taught the basics, and just resorts to asking you the same questions over and over again. Really disappointing and pretty useless."
"Update: 2 months, still not earning points for completing lessons. The latest update has made the app even glitchier than before. I haven't earned points/gems for completed lessons since the update (aside from when watching ads or opening treasure chests). Aside from the hopefully temporary glitch, I love this app. Updated about a week later: I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, still not getting points/gems for completing lessons."
"Duolingo is a great app in learning different languages, and it forces you to consistently learn it everyday or you lose all your achievements on the app. The one thing I find in this app that needs improvement is that, they should allow people to interact through ""voice note"" so that we can be better when interacting with people in another language. Duolingo is great in individual writing skills, and individual speaking skills but interacting speaking skills needs to be improved."
"I like it, it's good to learn languages, the only two issues I have are When I'm asked to say something in another language, and I say it bang on, but it still says to try again And whenever I need to draw a letter (for example, I learn chinese) and had to draw 啡 and it was super strict with how I draw it. For example, if I did the right part first, it would say it's wrong even though it would be correct no matter what way I draw it."
"Definitely makes learning a language fun (and addicting). Not having a subscription is tolerable, if you're patient with yourself. I wouldn't rely on this entirely for seriously learning a language, because it doesn't cover grammar very thoroughly. Although I understand the necessity of learning a language ""as you go,"" focused grammar study is important. Duolingo would help students more if a quick grammar rule was taught each time a new grammar concept was introduced. This need not be dry!"
"This is a fun game to play! It is well designed to keep you invested. Sadly there is no way to personalize it so our trip has come and gone before we were taught how to speak as a tourist. I am so done with talking about pens and school. Duo, please find a way to personalize the learning. I have no reason to EVER use the work, school or university information that is on my path before I can say turn left or turn right. I have come so close to deleting the app never to return but we keep trying!!"
Great for learning a little bit of a language (no fluency but for sure some basic knowledge). My only two issues are that it is hard to know when plural you and when singular you is used without getting a hint. It'd be nice if that could be clarified somehow. The other is that there is no section for grammar whatsoever which makes it incredibly hard to learn specifically verbs and their conjugations. Instead you learn every verb-form as its own word. It doesn't give any rules what to do.
"Generally amazing language learning app but the AI-based(?) course improvement feature is impacting my experience badly. Please add an option to opt out/reverse the automatic course adjustments or improve it as it ruined/stalled my progress for quite some time. All completed units now contain several new words, sometimes 50%+ of the content is new, including grammar. Old vocab & grammar I already learned will be repeated in upcoming units. The topical progression also became less logical."
"really enjoy it so far! can't think of any improvements it may need. Edit: Aggressive ads to make me buy the premium version? I've bought it, and I will again in just can't afford it right now. So just because of that unethical business tactic I'm giving it two stars. You should rely on the quality of your app, not overly numerous ads to profit. I understand the need for ads of we're not paying for the premium. But at this point with all companies it's a war for attention and it's unethical."
"I started using Duolingo in 2016 and due to some recent update it completely deleted my account and I wrote to customer service who never responded. Nevertheless I started a new account, but now I'm traveling and want to practice in the country I'm in, but it won't let me log in unless I have a local number from the country I'm traveling in... literally learning a language to travel, but can't practice while I'm traveling. Terrible experience. Would not recommend for people who plan to travel."
Excellent app with a wide variety of languages and especially good for beginning to learn those with scripts different from Latin. Even the free version is sufficient. It's a versatile tool that's as good as your ability to use it. It's so good that's it's even a favourite among those who like to bash other apps and platforms inorder to promote their own.
"They restructured the Japanese language course and threw me into a whole new Section that assumes I know a lot of words that I haven't learned yet. I can barely progress following the new lesson structure and I don't even know which lessons I should go back to. An option to revert back to the older structure, at least until I finish the section I was originally on would be nice."
"Exceptional to use for beginners but here's an option. When you are learning the language of your choice you compete with other users that are learning a different language. I would suggest to separate those learning Gaelic into a Gaelic league & those into other separate leagues as per their own language. This way we would be able to compete with someone with the same challenges. The loophole as it is that I can use the English as a ""cheat"" tactic since I already speak English. Just sayin"
"It has been revised. It's more gamified and is more fun, but I think I'm missing the writing parts. Maybe they're coming up as I advance. I think this is a fun way to learn basic vocab and grammar. Of course, as with everything, you get more out of it if you put more time in. Fun, not magic! NB: Impossible to find pricing for premium plan. This info should be very easy to find. One star off."
This app is great 130 days in. Only real problem is that I get warnings in the middle of the night telling me I'm going to lose my streak and use a streak freeze regardless of whether I have done a lesson that day or not. I really wish they would fix this glitch. Also when I get an answer wrong the correction often covers up my answer so I can't check it to see what I did wrong. Then it kicks you out if you get too many wrong instead of just making you a watch an ad or something.
"I would've happily given Duolingo 5 stars as I really enjoy it had they not completely ripped me off. they advertise the 2 week trial of Superduolingo by saying that they will alert you 2 days prior to the trial ending so you can decide if you want to keep it or not before you are charged. well they never sent me any notices. not in the app, not in my email, nada. so I didn't realize until a few days later that it was past the trial date & by then I was charged $85. don't do the ""free trial""!!!"
"Fun video game, terrible way to learn a language. I'm over 400 days into an unbroken streak and consistently place in the leaderboards. Yet, I can't speak the language at all and can barely read signs when I visit. It offers no foundation into the grammar and rules of the language, offers little to no repetition or vocabulary building, not even flashcards. It's a fun video game but useless as a learning tool. I'd recommend try ANYTHING else."
"The comments section had very useful tips on the language I was learning, and I browsed it often. It's been removed for whatever reason, and i think it should be re-added. Profile pictures have also been removed and replaced with avatars that are devoid of life. At least with uploaded photos, it felt somewhat like a person was on the other end of that username. The app is still fun, but updates have definitely made it worse."
"Loving every course I've started and I'm confident if I actually stick with it I'll be multilingual in no time! I have two different accounts on the same family plan between my old apple device and this android. Around seven courses each, going back and forth between devices makes the number of courses I've taken on seem more manageable. BTW, the new music theory course is FANTASTIC and the new math course is perfect for young kids and adults who want to regain lost skills and/or brain train."
"This language learning app is amazing! I love how I can choose between using a plan or not, I can learn at my own pace, and they always motivate me to learn every day and keep my streak growing. Learning spanish in school was a struggle, but now I can enjoy it and correct my mistakes. And the adds I feel are very minimal, so I only focus on my quick but rewarding lessons."
"A helpful language-learning tool, but in need of improvements. Search capability would be helpful to review specific categories, rather than following a specific path. They also purposely place buttons to use gems (buy & use timer boost packs, increase 2X periods) in ways that you are very likely to hit accidentally (e.g., timed tasks), which is very frustrating when this is not your intent -- they insert screens everywhere else except when they're trying to take your gems. Unsure if I'll renew."
"I can't get enough of Duolingo! This app has revolutionized the way I learn languages. The interactive lessons, engaging exercises, and friendly interface make learning a new language a breeze. Whether it's brushing up on basics or diving into more advanced topics, Duolingo has it all. The gamified approach keeps me motivated, and the bite sized lessons fit perfectly into my daily routine. Plus, the variety of languages available ensures there's always something new to explore."
overall a good app and good concept to try and make learning feel like a game. it's especially helpful to someone who would like to learn a new language but doesn't stay focused as easy. Good ways to review things you don't quite remember and lots of help as you go make it a very ideal language app. Overall I don't know how much better it can be besides maybe a few gripes some may have that are small its a very nice app for learning new languages
"I had downloaded this app after my mock results at school where i was failing french and have already made significant improvements in a month and am now passing french by just using this app alone. This app is perfect to learn from as long you keep with your ""streaks"" for 2-5 minutes per day and the game style is also engaging. Its in depth, offers tips and is enjoyable. I dont have duolingo ""super learner"" but it is not necessary to use app at all."
I appreciate the app. It's helpful to brush up on french but I hate the freeze streak intensity. I wish I could turn freeze streaks off. I get on when I gave time I don't need to be inundated with freeze streak reminders and goals. Im sure some ppls learning styles may like that but I find it cumbersome. Please make a way to turn freeze streaks off for ppl who don't need that incentive. For ppl who do like it they can keep it on.
"A great deal of fun learning a new language : È molto divertente imparare una nuova lingua. Keep in mind, concentrate only on your individual progress and learning. There are a bunch of people who either already know the language or use duolingo as though it is a game to score points and defeat everyone else involved, making it difficult to advance levels. Apparently, these folks have hours to score thousands, ensuring they advance but average learners don't. Its still enjoyable."
"I totally love the app and the way you can learn a language! (Ok, maybe you could learn some basics earlier in the course) But overall I love it. Only 2 things I really hate are: the ""I can't listen now"" is on the wrong place, or you should confirm it. You tap it to easily when you go to the next question. And the 2nd thing...I personally hate the super duo Lingo. Once in a time I get a couple of days free....BUT I DON'T WANT IT, I HATE IT!!!! So please let us choose if you want it!"
"I've definitely learned a lot from Duo, but I don't like the heart system very much (there are ways to get around paying for hearts, but it's a little annoying). The ranking system is a little weird as well. Additionally, some translations don't fit quite right, and it doesn't explain grammatical stuff very well, but overall, you can learn quite a bit as long as you get in the habit of doing a few lessons everyday"
"Good for adding vocabulary, although sometimes not as relevant as one might like. For example, after level one I can say 'My neighbour is timid', which could come later in the course with some more frequently used vocabulary learned earlier on. I feel this would give me more of a sense that I am actually achieving something."
"As someone who used it as a way to stop playing completely mindless phone games on my phone, I think it works pretty well, with the heart system stopping me from going too long. When compared to other mobile games it holds up pretty well, the ads aren't too invasive but they push the membership a lot. Main issues are that leaderboard and match madness are pay to win. Plus, it doesn't teach much, the sentences sound fake, and the placement tests are broken. It's annoying at times but pretty good"
"I love Duolingo. The app has taught me a lot of vocabulary and useful phrases, which is what I expected, but using it often (a few times a day) has given me confidence to speak Spanish to native speakers in both my work and personal life. The ads are annoying, but you can upgrade to Super Duolingo and blah blah blah. Despite the ads and my frugal app spending, Duolingo is great."
It's alright. It is definitely not perfect. I find it is helping me a bit but I don't find it will fully help me learn French. The learning progress is not very decent at times. Some lessons are extremely easy and others are extremely difficult. I find the progression is not very decent. This is a programming issue. The sounds effects of mistakes do not help too in my opinion. After awhile this makes you feel like a failure and it becomes negative which makes you want to stop.
"Thank you for making me competitive and utilizing my love for games in the most productive way. The app is perfect for learning any popular language in the most simplified and fun manner. Just one problem, the app shows ""You're offline"" sometimes and spontaneously even when my mobile data is working perfectly on other apps like Google. Kindly fix this, thank you ❤️"
Duolingo French is a wonderful app that makes fun and easy learning. However my greatest challenge is the speaking part. I often use the recorder to record my voice but it keeps telling me that my response isn't correct and for that reason I can't move over to the next page. I have been in stage 2 for over 3 days now and can't advance until I answer correctly the speaking part. I don't know if the recorder isn't recording my voice or the audio isn't recognizing my answers as a native. Pls help!
"they fired almost everyone who worked for them and replaced them with AI. They lock the best features for education behind a paywall. Duolingo is fun, but you'd need to get a premium account and devote at least 30 minutes a day to actually learn a language with it in a reasonable time frame. It's Stories are probably the best feature they had, and now it's premium only."
It became impossible to continue lessons on the app because the hints were so screwed up and they didn't organize the lessons in a way to understand the brand new concepts. I am extremely upset because I cannot get any partial refund since they make you pay for the whole year upfront and the issue only got this bad when I reached a new section. I also had emailed customer service and received no actual response even after 2 weeks. I had a 4 year streak but enough is enough.
"Latest update is even worse. The current structure does not work well and makes lessons particularly confusing and removes revision options. Update: new structure is still terrible and learning progress is halted tremendously. Please also stop automatically skipping ahead in lessons. It forces new lessons without having the chance to practice current ones. And stop forcing super duolingo on me! I do not want it, and will not buy it. Forcing me to use it makes me not want to use this app."
"Great app, but in the beginning (at least in Spanish) it really misses a key word, which is surprising. For example, I'm almost done with unit 1 and it still hasn't mentioned a single thing about the word ""nosotros"". Maybe it doesn't feel that that's important or maybe it isn't used much? I just started learning Spanish so I'm not sure"
"I really like this app as it has improved my other language skills SO much! But I wish I could turn off the weekly leaderboard thingy, because my life is pretty hard and busy these days (I still wanna keep my streak) and I dont have the time to get that much ""XP"", and its really stressing that im always just falling off to the previous league. Moral of the story: Can you please add an option to turn off weekly leaderboards? 💚"
"Dropping all the way to 1 star. I pay for the premium service, and as of today (3/18/24), I haven't been credited ANY XP since this morning. I am vigilant about playing 2-3 times daily. Suddenly, I am not getting XP, nor am I credited for completing daily tasks. They made it a competition and then took my legs from under me by cheating me. I'm sick of emailing them EVERY DAY about one problem or the other. FIX IT DEVS!!! I pay to play, not to be distressed daily. I wish 0 🌟 was possible."
"The progression is very good. I like how we learn by using and reusing the same words and sentences. Learning grammar and rules is ok, but practice makes perfect right? Duo builds your reflexes so you know how to say something without having to first think about the rules. And it feels a bit like a game, so you want to do 'just one more'... :) Great app."
"Pros: Enjoyable interface. Great materials & variety of aspects. Formatted for efficient & coherent learning. The difficulty level good for progressing, unlike other apps from random levels. Progression path clear. Cons: AmEnglish. Subscribers still are asked to pay for extras. Unnatural word order translations (Italian>English). Match Madness words appear severely delayed to lose & buy boost. Ramp-up boost always deducts gems but not always acknowledges the 80xp was successful & asks to repeat."
"Overall an ok app for very beginners...the app has a glitch in listening despite correct pronunciation (only for '50 euros' and '10 euros' in Italian-my pronunciation is perfect as I speak Spanish, but it won't accept it no matter how many times I repeat it! ) No opportunity for continuous dialogue. I think this is the biggest downfall. No opportunity to print lessons. I've tried contacting support but no response."
"Not particularly logical, new concepts introduced at random. Very childish in places and not helpful with learning grammar. I still don't understand the rewards system. Irritatingly frequent reminders to practice. If I was starting a language from scratch, I think I'd find it difficult with this app, and I wouldn't pay to use it."
Really helpful for language learning and good for encouraging daily learning. Slightly centred on the Americas as I learned Portuguese only to realise that some words were different as Duolingo had focused on Brazilian Portuguese rather than European Portuguese. Also the English translations are in American English so are slightly different. It generally is very helpful though and a fun way of learning.
"After four years, the lessons are too hard. I'm going back and starting over. There's so much I don't understand. The app only let me go back to the beginning of Unit 40, but I need to relearn some things way before that. The changes that were made a year or so ago that were supposed to make the app more personalized are not personal. The things I need help with are never retaught. The old app before the updates had conversations that were very helpful to me. It also let me go back to relearn."
This is so much more fun and interactive than previous language apps i have used. And im actually learning and sticking to it! 5 stars! 15/3/24 FEEDBACK EDIT: Lately the app has been resetting my progress every time i log in and I have to keep repeating lessons. Please fix this glitch as I am becoming quite frustrated at never moving forward.
"Duolingo was fun at first but when I tried creating a profile, it kept saying that I didn't create one. I kept on creating a new one, but it did not help. Duolingo NEEDS to fix this. As well as that, I believe the heart system is outrageous. It is basically saying you are not allowed to make mistakes and you get punished for it. This is extremely frustrating because learning a new language is not easy. Also, most of the things that SHOULD be already provided needs to bought with a subscription."
there used to be a vocabulary of the words you've learned. It was very useful. It's sadly gone. The app could also do better when providing theory for the unit. Like what forms the words might have. Now you just kind of try to pick up while doing lessons instead of having a definition somewhere you can come back to.
"This app is AMAZING! I love how short each level is. Learn as much as you what, when you want, and how you want. I also like how when you start a language course you take a ""placement quiz."" That way if you have some prior knowledge of a language it can place you accordingly. Also the achievements and badges you can earn are motivating. :) Fantastic work, Duolingo!"
"This app was excellent up until the recent ""path"" update. In their attempts to gamify the app, it's become slow and tedious taking an incredibly long time to learn any new words at all. No longer really that useful for learning a language compared with the old configuration. I suppose they did this to push people into using the paid version, but the new update is so hopeless I have less interest than ever."
"I have used it for Italian and, currently, French over the years to get some basic language skills for holidays. It's better than just a phrase book but the frequent push to upgrade to the paid version is intrusive. I understand they need to make money but I find only having so many 'lives' makes it more challenging."
"I absolutely love this app, the little characters are adorable, the artwork is adorable and things are simple to learn, it may take a little while to get used to a new lesson but practice makes perfect. Only thing I wish is if in each lesson there were more varieties and a little more advanced sections to get to to expand the conversation of topics you are currently in. Maybe it will get more like that with similar sections like travel. Otherwise it's motivational and great to learn."
"When English is the native language used by the learner, the exercises are fairly good and very imaginative at times, but if I do the same course using Spanish as the native language, often times the translations provided are irrational and grammatically incorrect. Also feedback is often not working for such examples hence I'm leaving my feedback here."
The app still keeps bombarding me with the Super Duolingo plan literally after every lesson I do and I'm still NOT INTERESTED IN SUPER DUOLINGO!!! My 1 star rating will stay here until this changes which is a shame because otherwise I really like the app and it moves my language learning progress forward. It is just disgusting practice...
"I love using this app to learn Spanish but I feel like it rarely actually teaches me and relies solely on repetition. Which is fine, I just wish it taught me based on common mistakes. Also, I just completed 5 levels during a double XP time and it didn't count any of my points on the leaderboard??? Can this get fixed??"
"Some aspects are good but what is annoying is that on the end lesson (wrap up lesson) it will throw stuff at you that wasn't covered in the section. Probably so you waste hearts and need to buy more. Also, don't even bother with this app if you cannot perfectly roll your rrr's because the speaking exercises will repeatedly fail you on words like aeropuerto and rosa (spanish).There is also no theory or explanation on grammar etc they just throw you in to words and phrases without any structure."
"I use it to learn Korean and the stages are jumping from syllables and easy words to whole long complicated sentences in no time. From Stage 4 I get new words (that aren't marked as new words) and whole new sentences in almost every lesson. When I decide to practice the level, it only gives me a few new words and mostly words from the previous stages. Also, NO explanation whatsoever! E.g why we add different endings to the words, why we have 2 Goodbyes. You have to find it on your own elsewhere."
good app to learn basic Spanish but impossible to progress once you get to a higher level without super duolingo. cannot learn from mistakes as you have to continously quit the lesson. should make it a better learning experience for people who don't want to pay like unlimited hearts. adds also super annoying as they force you to watch one after every lesson. do not recommend.
"I'm 152 into learning Japanese. Overall, it's not bad, there are times when it's frustratingly slow, and teaching me words that I'm obviously never going to use in any scenario, but I am learning from it. My biggest gripe is with how it teaches kanji, it does it completely different from anything else, and fails to explain a lot of things that would make it easier to understand and remember, but unfortunately, I also haven't come across anything else that teaches kanji much better."
"Surprisingly fun for this 60 year old who doesn't like video games in general. Nearly two years in now, I am not confident in speaking to someone, 1000 word vocabulary but unless I want to tell someone my penguin eats cake is pretty useless vocabulary. Very recently things are more complex, but the vocal prompts do not always match the choices offered. This is getting to be an issue for continuing my streak as only give errors are allowed in a lesson."
This programme enables me to learn at my own pace. The rate I get through a section depends on my ability to understand the subject matter which is varied. I do not feel under pressure if I am struggling. This style of learning creates an atmosphere which for me is conducive to learning....a first.....This suits my learning style as I am still having daily French lessons one year on....
"It was great until I discovered offline lessons are not a thing anymore. I will be offline while travelling for a few days, duolingo would have been perfect during down time before going to bed, but I guess it won't be possible. It was a thing in 2021, now it only download a miserable number of lessons that you will complete in half an hour maximum. Would be a 5 stars if not for that ridiculous decision."
"The system is good as it creates a cometition and helps motivate. What's lacking is detailed explainations of grammer. As well it allows, for example, a simplified phrase in one exercise but then in another execrise considers it wrong and expects a more formal phrase with no obvious rational reason. There is also no reason given to necessarily use one word over another when both can be used and it's then marked wrong."
"Used to be fun but recently seems to be full of people who must spend 24hrs a day on it. I cannot and get demoted to the lower league. One voice is so fast it's impossible to understand, as I struggle with some word recognition having many similar words in the choices boxes is very difficult. Again, the typing exercises are so difficult for dyslexic people, whole app seems to be against dyslexia sufferers. It has just started asking me to listen to subjects I have not even covered on home page"
"First, I pay for this app. The cost a day is that of a tall starbucks drink. I see a ton of negative reviews since the last update. Honestly, I have zero problems. The complaints seem like ppl who may not be able to learn academically or tech swavey. So some advice: the predictive text issue, you need to go to your phones settings, to keyboard, and add the language you're learning. It helps. For voice issues, speak slowly and into your phones mic. Also, issues may be due to phones' ages."
"I love the way there are no lessons as such. You just work through the exercises. I'd change two things. The noises when doing speaking exercises are too loud and annoying, especially for other people in the room. Also I'd like to be able to choose what day to have happy hour. I often work Saturdays. But minor quibbles. This is fantastic. My kids love using it. And I do."
"I'm having trouble getting support from the help or repots crew. The game is malfunctioning in some lessons, and I have reported it 3 times. Responses are always the same with asking for more details, screenshots so far have not worked, but my description of the issue has been given. I think more help, because, I have been unable to continue playing because of the issues reported. I need real help, not computer generated responses."
"I have gone from conflicted to hating this app. I play every day, yet some days I start & it tells me I haven't played the day before & requires me to unfreeze it. I don't know if this is because I travel a lot & am in different time zones & it throws the app off, but it becomes so frustrating. I honestly, in 4 months, haven't learned much of anything & feel I'm wasting my time."
"I have used Duo for a few years to learn Spanish. Its been ok but very limited conversation practice, but adequate vocab practice. What i dont like is the 'nagging' and lack of new examples. Also, the app is too perfectionist for someone wanting simple conversation skills regardless of perfection. I think helpful conversation is give-n-take, asking clarifying questions and being flexible\foregiving. Instead of the leaderboard, i would prefer a friendly avatar inviting me to a conversation..."
"I have used this app a lot to learn Japanese over the past year or so, but the newest update messed with a lot of my progress. A lot of courses I completed are no longer legendary status, and when I go to review them they're full of material I hadn't learned before. It'd be great if I could reset those courses so I can catch up on material fully"
"Started in 2018 but stopped around 2020. I restarted in Jan 2024. I feel it's worth paying premium to support the app. In addition, they also have a podcasts to help you hit your language learning goals. There's a competitive aspect (league boards) to help motivate people like me learn a little more every day. Bug: sometimes the XP score for the league board isn't updated or it even goes back to a previous total. So, while my two day XP count is around 2,850, my league score is only at 2,400."
"A cool and fun way to learn loads of languages without prior knowledge. The app seems to focus more on how you say things than learning nouns, so you should be mindful you'll need to do that separately to get more vocabulary. I use the free version which has ads and lives, but the app makers seem very generous with ways to earn your lives back. I really like the quality of the app and would recommend it easily to anyone wanting to learn languages."
"I loved learning Hindi 15-20 minutes a day. The repetition helps it stick. That said, Duolingo is incomplete for Hindi. If you stick with it for 6 months you'll complete the entire track. It's 100% repetition after that. They don't even vary up daily review lessons. It's pretty bad. You want to keep the learning streak going, but don't want to use the app. Also lacks teaching of grammar or rules. You just have to figure it out (use Pimsleur to learn rules and more correct pronunciation)."
"It is DEEPLY discouraging to put in months, and months and years of daily effort only to have your entire path of progress scrambled and revamped with ""new and improved content!"" The entire concept of a gamified path is useless if the path can be rewritten at any time. I'm now facing the prospect of what feels like starting over. AGAIN. and it's honestly hard not to just quit. Especially when I cannot have any faith that my new efforts won't be wiped out in the next update."
"Changing to 3 stars for the extremely poor Ukrainian numericals speech recognition. It looks like it's not just bad but an obvious bug, like a wrong dataset. I thought it was just me, but it wouldn't even recognize my wife's speech, who is Ukrainian and this is her native language. Not a single number is recognized, even those that sound the same in russian (I an a native speaker). Overall, many other words are stressed incorrectly, and have different variants in the male and female voices."
Duolingo makes it fun and easy to learn a new language. The app does a good job of gamifying the learning and using other psychological tricks to make you stick with it. It's also fun and easy enough for my young kids to use and get excited about. I've been able to replace TV time with learning a new language time and they ask me to use it vs me making them do it
"I still use it, but I don't suggest it for new users. It's all about competition, and the free version is basically useless. They like to upgrade graphics, but the learning experience has only gotten worse. You're either not learning because you only care about points or you're not learning because you're limited to five mistakes per day. You can pay to get out from under the five mistake limit, but then it's all about competing. This is a classic case of an app that lost its way after growing."
"I have been using the app for more than three years to learn Japanese. At first it was great. More recently it's gone downhill for a couple of reasons. Most importantly, the community forums are gone now. That means you don't get to hear what's currently popular in speech, and it removes interaction with people from the language. Also the explanatory lessons are now quite sparse and difficult to find so a lot of context is missing. Another problem the forums used to solve."
"It might be better to customise the studies depending on why user is studying the language. 20% of the words I am forced to learn that I dont need. For example going to school vocabulary is not reqlly needed for me but I had to go through it. Moreover, when I first reached stage 2 I was taken back to course 4 on stage 1 as you made an update which was very annoying. Recently, for some reason I was automatically moved 2 lessons ahead without any explaination. Overall, I like it. Thank you!"
"Many bugs. In btwn exercises, speaking/listening ones are turned off on its own even after turning it on again manually. No I hadn't touched the ""can't listen/speak now"" option but it smhw turns it off again! And the 2XP booster isn't always activated, just now I was completed one level and got the booster but it disappeared when I went to another lesson. Plus, it would be better if you rank normal and super users seperately, it's not a fair competition right now. Gems are also hard to gain."
"It won't update, and there are a lot of glitches lately. It didn't track my points or progress. I was moved down in the leagues because my score wasn't updated. The ""Early Bird"" and ""Night owl"" chests don't unlock during the time frames stated after doing a lesson. One listening lesson kept showing I didn't do it. I did it 3+ times until it finally updated. Lessons doesn't always complete, so the app doesn't move on to the next lesson. I've tried restarting my phone and force stopping the app."
"Great app for learning new language, but it's really frustrating they've removed the option to view all the words you've learnt. So there's no way to quicky see your progress. Seems really ridiculous. Everything is geared towards making you want to pay for super also, which I won't be, so will see how long I use it for"
"It's the best app for learning any language you wish to. It teaches you everything, scratch by scratch. Its fun and one of the most useful app i have ever downloaded. Edit: Hello! I am back to change my review, recently they have removed the discussion centre from the exercises. Since it was the only way i could get to understand the (Turkish) grammar but they changed it so i would take away 1 star from my review. Thank you."
"Duolingo is undoubtedly the best language-learning app I've ever come across. Its intuitive interface, comprehensive lessons, and interactive exercises make the language-learning journey both enjoyable and effective. Whether you're a beginner or looking to brush up on your language skills, Duolingo offers a tailored experience to suit your needs. The gamified approach keeps you motivated and engaged, while the progress tracking feature allows you to see your improvement over time. 💯"
It's really great app. The layout is easy to navigate and user friendly. One thing I don't like. The notification are constant reminders to practice are like thorns. I have a busy day like everyone else. If I snooze the reminder notification make it longer than 30 mins before you remind me again. Maybe make them 3 or more hours between each one.
"The quality of the french course is getting worse with every update. The french being taught is often incorrect and the sentences are clunky and unnatural. It is obvious that Duo is being cheap and using AI, rather than actual speakers of those languages. I am currently a super member, but will not be renewing as I no longer trust what I am being taught."
"I am enjoying the app, but I think one easy thing that could be changed would be to include the names under the characters image in a story or conversation. I get the two characters mixed up when reading a story or conversation, because I forgot who's who. This confusion makes it hard to follow along, read, and comprehend the story, selecting the right answers as the story progresses."
"the app is great and all, but my issue is with the booster purchase through gems. i need there to be a confirmation pop-up that shows up whenever you want to get them (more preferable at the middle of the phone screen). this night makes it the fourth time i'm buying the 5x booster due to my annoying phone, and i'm fed up. 😕 no other issue whatsoever. it's a great app!"
"very good app and materials for learning new languages. I just wish they spent more time reinforcing the vocabulary learned than introducing new one too quickly. The more lessons you do on one day, the more complex it gets as opposed to done 1 lesson one day and practice before moving on to the next lesson. Overall, it is a great resource to start learning a new language."
"Good for learning to read and listen. Not so good for conversation. Annoying that translations to perfectly acceptable UK or Australian English are marked as a mistake because US English is different. E.g. We say ""We celebrate New Year"" but it is marked incorrect because US says ""We celebrate New Year's.""!!! And this is an app that says it has AI! Perhaps it should have English English and Australian English as alternative languages to American English."
"It's great to learn new languages with, but lacks explanation when you get to the possessives and plurals. Other than that, it's great especially since we get to learn more languages for free (Granted there are a butt load of ads but they at least they don't interupt you in the middle of your lesson which i appreciate.) They make it competitive and to where you want to beat the others in the league. 😅 My friends and I will go ham trying to beat everyone else out of the leaderboards."
"Don't like the last update, unnecessary gimmick added at the end of each lesson that waste three seconds each time. It's not a game, get rid of it. Even with the animation switched off in the settings, it still shows, it's very annoying. Yes you can show me the xp and time, no need for all that, I'm a superuser and I want to have the option as a paying user to not see that. Or else it's bye bye. Remove it and I remove this review."
A really good app to start off and learn any language that you're interested in learning. I'm on a 43 days streak and I'm still going on. There are a few things that are a bit wrong since I'm learning a language I should've known but sadly wasn't taught. My mom has noticed that it adds words to make the sentences more long but otherwise is teaching me good.
"this app is great, and it very much helps with learning languages. however, it has an excessive amount of ads, with an ad shown every 2-3 lessons. it doesn't sound that bad, but lessons take 3 minutes tops, and i usually complete them in 1:30. that's an ad every 4 minutes and a half. insanity."
"I really enjoy using this app in the mornings before work. The gamification makes it a bit easier to stick with versus other methods of learning a new language. My wife and I got the Super Family Plan since we both use the app often on our phones. I think Duolingo is great for daily practice and getting the basics down. That said, I'm not sure if one can become fully fluent on Duolingo alone."
"I like the app, I own the yearly subscription, and make my relatives learn the languages hustle free. One note, though - recently, animations in my app stopped working completely. Dunno what to do. In addition, whenever I receive a double xp reward after the lesson, it's not adding up to my end result points. I noticed many bugs are happening these days"
"Wish they finished the Thai language course. I've been learning French with them and enjoyed the app so far, but I've read that they will not by finishing their Thai language course, which is disappointing. It seems like there would be a large number of English tourists who want to visit southeast Asia and would use a course like this so I can't understand why they would can that course."
"I was a quite a long way through Japanese, using lots of kanji in a variety of sentence structures, but since the newest update, it's giving me everything in Hiragana, not Kanji, and it's turned from complex sentences to ""baseball player"". I don't understand why they've changed it. Maybe it's trying to cater to new learners, but the Japanese course is now so basic that its essentially useless. I've used Duolingo for years, and I'm on a 424 day streak, so I'm hoping they change it back. Please!!!"
"It's a very good app. Ads are moderaded, and they don't really disturb. My problem is the grammar in some languages. For example, in German. Even though I use properly the conjugation depending on the kasus (I don't know the word in english), it says it's wrong. Apart from that, it's a very good app. I anyways recommend to use it more as a complement than as your only way to learn a language. P.D: thanks for giving me my dog back hahaha"
Since Duolingo went public the product has reduced in quality while spiking in cost. I used to pay for super but now it's prohibitively expensive while the actual learning tools stripped down in order to push the monetization of the product. They removed great things like the forums that encouraged discussion and learning but never offered something in return. It's no longer for learning but another platform for ads and money making for investors. It's too bad it used to be a great product.
Duolingo has been very helpful for practicing Spanish. I've learned a lot. However I was getting stuck because I didn't know the grammar rules. Now I'm doing Spanish videos from YouTube as well as Duolingo and I find the two pronged approach to be very helpful. I'd really like to see Duolingo offer more grammar. Or maybe I'm not looking in the right spot. It helps so much to understand which form of a word to use. There are some very simple tools that can help a lot.
"The time on XP Ramp Up Challenge on Level 3 is way beyond ridiculous hard at this point. Especially when it comes to the +40XP part, the time is getting reduced to like 1:30. And when you can't finish it when the time is up, you have to spend more on gems to extend the time. And if you don't want to spend it, you could literally just end the session."
"Life long dream of learning Japanese, might actually come true at last. I really wish there was a way to turn off the streak, I don't care about the godamn streak or who's scaling what mountains. In addition, I want to be able to custom modify the kinda lessons I go through. I want to focus on sentence construction, and words, but I have to keep going through the alphabets, it's so frustrating."
"Doesn't teach, just throws you into guessing words til you chose right. It's pay to win (ridiculous for a lang learning app) Updates course & messes progress, whole units added that you already ""passed"" but never learned. Repetitive not in useful way, just boring. Don't use to actually learn a lang, use it like flashcards once you already started learning the lang, except it doesn't let you choose what to learn, lessons are fixed & you have to do them in order. 'Gamified' stuff just frustrating"
"User interface designed for 3-year old todlers. The app looks cute, but its overdone to a point where it is counter intuitive. Please give users an option with a less ""cutified"" and more ""to the point"" template for easy and fast navigation. Also, the Settings are not easy to find. Too many animations and notifications interupting your flow. And at the end of every speedrun, the app stalls (animations disabled in settings)."
"Completely garbage as of last update. Keeps freezing after a question, or failing to pick up speech at all. App in general always getting worse instead of fixing old bugs. They keep doing weird irrational things like making it harder ty type rather than use the word bank (which impairs learning), they push their useless microtransaction-bait ""challenge"" a ton, and they don't fix bugs with the speech recognition that have persisted for years. The devs should be bloody ashamed."
"for me personally the app is great to supplement what I am already learning with my polish tutor. it is helping me practice what I know more regularly and retain it better. my only reservation about the app is that it doesn't teach you the Gramma and conjugation, simply the words and phrases so I learn that with my tutor or look it up myself to be able to gain a full understanding of the language. it's good practice I just wouldn't solely use it to learn a language properly"
"it used to fun and make sense. I am 305 days into learning Chinese. however they updated the course, without resetting any lessons so now I don't know which cours contain what new words, thez aren't really explained in a new way anyways. All I can do now is to repeat the gold levels and do the 3 star challenges. This really downgraded the app...."
"It absolutely infuriates me that I lose my streak in less than 24 hours because the clock changes to a new calendar day. Seriously, I lost a streak in 8 hours or less. the streaks are nice and, in a way, they keep you going, however, Duolingo doesn't seem to understand the concept of what a day means. This wouldn't be so bad but duolingo doesn't really teach you. They tell you what to say but, not why it's said the way it is. I don't know any of the grammatical rules. Not a good way to learn."
"For practice exercises to be custom to the users, unit reviews and target practice should always be available. I am often doing my studies without sound on to avoid disturbing others. So when the featured practice is perfect pronunciation or listen up, all I can do is mistake review until that runs out. I use the practice exercises to hammer my studies home and I am very disappointed that the exercises I need are not always available."
"For the most part it is a good app, but glitches happen. For instance I just earned 280 XP after working for quite a while. My place kept up but then after a while it suddenly dropped me all the way down to a total of 52 XP this week. Very frustrating and no way to report the glitch."
The star-ranked rapid reviews and match madness exercises need to be reworked. Their difficulty and requirements ramp up way too high to complete without needing to use a bunch of power-ups that add more time. Other than this issue I love this app. Edit (3/25/2024): the above issue still persists despite seeing updates in the course. Reduced rating from 4 to 3 stars because of this. Disappointed.
"it's pretty amazing for learning the alphabet to your target language. If you're looking for an app to help you learn words, I think duolingo would work best if you're using other apps along with it and flash cards, etc. however I feel like the xp system needs improvement. duo encourages you to make language learning into a competitive game, but this doesn't work very well because it's a distraction from actually paying attention to what you're learning."
"I like the gamification because I'm an extremely competitive person. I also like that you have to use problem-solving to figure out what certain words and phrases mean. I have a degree in teaching English to speakers of other languages, and my students always say that learning English through immersion is very similar to what Duolingo tries to emulate through the problem-solving component. That said, you aren't going to become ""fluent"" using Duolingo. It's a good *supplement* for your study."
"The system is useful, but not great. They try too hard to push their paid service when it doesn't seem to add much value in learning a language. The way answers are scored (how words are graded and spoken) are inconsistent. And more can be done to support and encourage students in the process-the friends feature is almost worthless."
"It's a decent app, but I wish you would reduce the ai pronunciation content on the Japanese course. It's outright wrong a lot of the times, the grammar explanations are also very lacking. I wish the text was read by a human instead of the robot voice, it makes horrible mistakes and some letters like Chi vs Shi vs Ki are virtually indistinguishable to my ear when the A. I. is reading it. Please use more humans for a higher quality experience."
"I downloaded this a bit over a year (?) ago to learn French, and its helped me quite a bit. I can read French a lot better the speak it (but I'm still learning) . I'm also learning Dutch as well, as it's linguistically similar/close to English. If you want to start a new language, this would be a good steppingstone. Have a notebook when you start, to write down any tips that pop up during your lessons and any new words you learn. Just wish Estonian was an option too!"
"Stop giving us 6 to 8 xp when it's supposed to provide you 20 to 40 xp. It's super infuriating. There's also some words where you can't even translate without having the proper keyboard for it. Also, some of these courses are way too short and don't even provide the learning that everything comes with the languages, numbers, alphabet, etc... especially when we're paying over $100.00 a month for plus, and we don't even get full access to learn the entire language. Please fix this!!!"
"It's unbelievable, years later still missing the feature to grab and drag words to reorder them within a sentence. Each time you forget a word which belongs to the beginning of the sentence, you can't simply add the word and drag it where it belongs in the sentence. Somehow this works in the web version but not in the app."
"I have been learning Spanish for 4 years using Duolingo and counting. It motivates me every day to learn because of its reward system. Sometimes it's repetitive but it's build like that to ingrain the language in our brain. If you really want to speak a language however, you should choose to join the Duolingo online events with human teachers."
"Taken a real downturn since the recent update which changed all the modules. I was instantly thrown into grammar nightmare tests which I hadn't been taught yet. Yes it may be a better up to date module but it has thrown the current users in the dirt. I can't get through a single ""lesson"" (very loose use of word, unless you pay premium you get kicked out the 'class' after you run out of 5 lives, and left not learning anything at all) I really wish I could get the money back I threw into this."
"Great apl for learning a different language. Do have some options on what you can learn. I don't use the speaking ones. I wish the app would get rid of the spelling ones as those tend to get me messed up. Can't spell when typing regularly, let alone a foreign language. It's not a bad app, though. Change some things and give people more options on exercises they do."
I really like the interactive conversations they've added. I would love to see them more. I also like the linear track and that it lets me skip to any section. I just wish there was a way to choose more vocabulary. I feel like I review such a small list of words. Updating my review to say I love these super cute and funny listening exercises and the Duo widget.
"I really enjoy duolingo but for the past few weeks the app has slowed WAAAAYY down. If you're trying to compete in the tournaments, time is an asset. Each of the Speak exercises that add XP points slows down to a CRAWL taking 1.5 to 2 MINS to complete vs the 45-55 SECONDS I usually clock. I've tried reaching out via Feedback in the app several times but only getting auto email reply. App is fully updated, RAM is cleared. Really hope you reply and fix this .. I will update when theres a fix"
"The app works well, except it no longer gives me any rewards. If I complete a lesson without enough experience points to open a chest the ad will play. If I do a second lesson to open a chest the app freezes. When I quit and reopen the app (after waiting 2 to 3 minutes of perpetual loading following the lesson) it shows I've reached the points for the chest, but my gems haven't changed and I don't have another streak freeze. I'm pretty much perpetually stuck."
"Practice (repetition) is essential to remember words but that's only available with the paid version. Poor structure for teaching grammar, tenses & conjugation. Other than that, you pick it up over time, it does what it says. Paid App is great, free I'd likely drop in time."
"I enjoy duolingo and what it offers. Without premium, you can still learn whatever language you want, too. With premium, however, there are no ads, and you get unlimited hearts. The annoying thing is running out of hearts. You are trying to learn a language, and when you get stopped because you run out of hearts. I've learned a lot from duo. However, I feel like you have to be tutored or be in a language class to get everything. Duo doesn't explain everything. Especially conjagating verbs!!"
"Thank you for fixing the past error regarding the practice. When I entered yesterday to the app, it notified me that the Mandarin course was updated, then I make a new lesson and it shows me the same characters that I saw three exercises ago; however, the fact that when I wanted to practice to win hearts, I got characters that I never learned and that the app marked my answer wrong because I don't know them, that is unfair. Could you do me a favour and tried to fix that error please? Thank you."
"Duolingo is an excellent app to start learning a new language. The only thing I would say needs improvement would be, more work. I mean to say, give more options to learn. when doing my lessons, I rarely have to write and mostly selecting what I heard, while this helps me learn, it helps alot, I wish you could do other things, possibly more ""hands on"". Like make me create a sentence or a story. I'm not very far in my learning experience here, only two weeks in, so maybe I'm speaking too soon."
"The lessons are fairly easy, and you do learn quickly. I'm not really sure how accurate some of the words and phrases actually are because they don't match up with google or bing translate programs. Also, to be in constant competition with other learners is boring and distracting from why you want to learn a language."
"Good business model and a really bad app. Try something else before you advance too far and can't leave it (ie. their business model). Most frustrating app ever. Sooo many bugs and sooo little bug fixing. New! They removed community added content, which helped us learn more than the app itself. I have reported dozens of mistakes in the last 3 years, and they fixed maybe 3."
"If you use the paid for version or the free one you are still only dabbling in the language. I Would prefer that each language had its own points and hearts system, having one for all is disheartening. The app makes you learn lots of irrelevant things repetetively. It is not conversational at all, it is fairly usless at giving you a grounding or background or confidence in the language. But is user friendly and fun. So thats ok then."
"It's a great app for learning. I am currently learning Italian because some lines in one of the books I read are Italian. It's great and I love the speaking exercises. My only complaint is that the widget is a bit glitchy. Like, on the app it will say I have a 138 day streak but when I look at the widget it will say 136 or something. Not that much of a difference, but it's still there. Other then that, I love the app!"
Everything in this app is good for learning languages. But one of the worst thing i saw while learning korean. That the guide book is not well designed. Now i am in the unit 3 lesson 1. In this unit i saw a bunch of new words. But the words are not written in the guide book. I wish you will fix this for every units if they have this problem. Another one is the audio. Some audios are not clear and accurate as well as they should. I will update my review once all this issues are fixed.
"Nice, and free. But sometimes it is a little frustrating when your doing lets say a unit review and your told to translate a word you have never seen before even after completing the full unit. Same goes for the star courses its just annoying when you've completed the course in question yet when you do the star speed trial there are words that weren't in the unit... (wouldn't be a problem if the word was purple) But regardless this is a good app just a few annoying kicks every now and then."
"In the beginning, I thought the speed was too slow for my progression, but after I patiently took several courses, I realized it's actually the perfect speed for me to learn. Really love it. Recommend download it. Oh, and if you really want to enjoy the learning, you should pay for the super, which is really not what I like but necessary for me to stay engaged."
"Although the app has improved dramatically in terms of how it teaches Japanese and allows you to practice what you have learned, the problem of forced engagement and burnout has also gotten a lot worse. They keep raising the goalposts for both daily quests and monthly challenges, and it really gets in the way of learning. Fix these problems and the app would be stellar! Also, I would really love to see Ch'orti, Yucatec, Nahuatl, Mvskoke, Ainu, Louisiana Creole, and Cajun added."
"5 stars for the old app 3 stars for the updated version. The new update seems to be geared at getting more plus members. Penalizing mistakes by deducting hearts is pointless—it makes us *fear* making mistakes and that completely defeats the purpose of learning a new language! And the ads? I get you're trying to advertise Duolingo plus, but we don't need to see the same ad after every lesson to get the point. (I've been using Duolingo for over 2 years and so far it has helped me a lot)"
"I just love it everything is good in it ..no bugs ,no problems ,no ads!! It's a fun learning game in which u can learn languages in a fun way. it's a perfect app for learning 🩷.. u can learn as much as languages u want ! I'm learning japanese and I'm getting quite good at speaking so this app definitely deserves 5 stars 🌟..there might be 1 ad coming but it doesn't affect the learning cause its not too much disturbing and the 1 ad if for getting super duolingo so we can learn better!"
"Duolingo is definitely one of the best ways to learn a language, because it works on a very specific learning aproach when it never stops challenging you. The opportunity to advance through the leagues is the best side of this app, because it doesn't only teach you a language. It keeps you entertrained and motivated to earn xp as well, which makes this app stand out above the other ways of learning."
"I'm a long time user but I haven't like the heart system. You can only make 5 mistakes? That's insane and really discouraging for people who want to learn. And paying for it isn't in my list of financial priorities. Edit - new update switched up all the lessons for me, disappointed again. At this point I'm just logging in to continue my 2+ year streak."
"I have the premium, and its very nice! Not being afraid of being penalized for making a mistake really helps. I'm learning Mandarin currently, and they just added a writing practice for characters, which is very nice. They also updated the learning course... which is fine, but I wish they took into account that theres now a bunch of words that are in previous lessons that I haven't learned yet, that show as me having learned them already."
"A great app to learn the basic of languages. For example, I'm currently learning Japanese and it is going rather smoothly. I'm using the free version, and it still works out alright. I just dislike how we can't access things that could help benefit our learning, since you need to pay for it. Nonetheless, amazing app."
"Free (with ads) but of limited benefit. *For* Linearly structured learning. Repetitive drills. Help in reading, listening, and a little writing. *Against* Exercises: language very unnatural. Exercises: lack coherence. Useless words repeated ad nauseam (e.g. pingouin, trousse). Mistakes: many of my Italian corrections were accepted. French version is more obstinate; many of my evidently correct answers were marked incorrect. You won´t learn language using Duolingo alone."
"I have been learning German for just over a year. For the most part, the app is really good, but it needs to be used alongside another learning method (classes, etc). My one frustration is that sometimes I am not sure about the answers, so end up guessing. The app tells me I am ""Awesome"", but in reality, I am not sure about my answer. I would rather it showed be the phrase in both English and German in the pop-up box for every question."
"This is a great app as a supplementary resource for learning a foreign language. I started on the free plan with ads, but I then moved to the paid plan without ads, and it is so worth it. The app uses the Common European Framework (CEF) to describe the language proficiency levels (i.e. A1-C2), which is very useful. And the app has an excellent user interface as well. Kudos to the designers and developets, great work!"
"Tried for 1 week and made significant progress, but im completely unable to use the voice features as it doesn't work on my Galaxy Note 20 Android. I've tried everything on my own to resolve, but no use. I would give 5 stars, but for the reliance on Google voice features. Sadly, I received no assistance from the Help team although I submitted 2 tickets. It's still usable without the voice features, but missing the satisfaction of having some perfect lessons."
"Super sub is worth it. Cute design that really helps you learn and retain a new language. The latest update lets you see words you learned! Super happy!! The notes can be a bit disorganized, but I negate this problem by taking my own notes. There are a lot of things I love about this app. It's the only language course I've stuck to, I've found most language programs to be super dry and boring. Duolingo's gamification of language learning works for me!"
I have now completed a 360 +streak May I make some suggestions 1. Very important ommission is that there is very little grammar explanation. It will help a lot if the learner would know why some prefixes change 2. With AI it would be nice to interact with vocally. I get no opportunity to speak the language I am learning I have reduced my rating to three stars. THERE IS NO COMMUNICATION FROM THE DEVELOPERS. No Grammer assistance. Even posting or email is ignored
No explanations for why your answer was not correct in most circumstances which means you don't learn the language so much as you learn which phrases duolingo likes. There is no flexibility in what you want to learn because each language only features one linear path to follow. More flexibility and more explanations would improve my motivation and ability to learn a language and make this app better.
"the streak mechanic is wildly stressful. there was no way to get an extended pause to my streak when i was literally the sickest i have ever been in my life and i don't like an app punishing me for having REAL ailments. everytime i have lost a streak, it was because i was battling illness or struggling with disabilities. being consistent every single day is hard, you shouldn't have to spend 500 gems every damn time. what happened to the challenge that appeared instead? i liked that"
"I've been doing Japanese on and off for years now, but really started taking it seriously this time. The app is great and I understand why there's ads after each lesson, honestly would just buy super because that's also great. I do think the leaderboards are a little unbalanced with everyone learning a different language at a different level, some people are way too advanced for it to be fair. My issue is, the words I was given in my Japanese lesson did not match what the voice was saying."
I have come to represent the reddit users trying to learn latin. They say that the app has a great ground work for latin in the first half of the coarse but then rushes through in the second half. It is also very short and uses English grammer rather than latin grammar. It doesn't teach past or future tense. I think you should expand the coarse to teach the language better and create 2 courses. for latin with a modern take and one with a classic take. It's a good it just need to be better
Harder to review things once you have passed the lessons. I'm learning japanese mostly now and because Kanji only get used every so often you learn the pronunciation over the actual characters. This might be intentional but when you see the same word many many many times it can get monotous. I'd rather they challenge me a bit more then bring previous words to remind me every so often as it's easy to forget the definition of a word in another language.
"The efficiency of learning words decreased tragically. With this new stile and linear learning line I don't have the choice anymore if I want to continue with another lecture. When I start a new lecture the picture-word connection is always the last ant the lecture need from me tu understand the new word immediately from writing. Please bring back the old app, or give me the possibility to downgrade this app, because I don't like the new stile and lecture organization."
"My daughter was using Duolingo to learn French. I love the idea of it and at first it was working fine. When she reached the Sapphire league she kept getting the answer right but it was marked as wrong! At first I thought it was the grammar (capitalisation/full stops) but even when her answer was identical in every way - EXACTLY the same wording, spelling, accents, grammar, etc. - it was still being marked as the wrong answer. She became very disillusioned and uninstalled it which is a shame."
"Duolingo is a fun way to learn language. It's very much like a game and they have mastered the art of using psychological tricks to get you to practice longer. However, it never really teaches language in a traditional sense. It just tests you on knowledge and shows you what is right and wrong. There are no lessons, per se. Therefore, it never really tells you WHY something is done a certain way - it just corrects you if you do it wrong."
"I've started learning Spanish a few years ago with Duolingo, it was nice and I had to complement with resources outside the app . needless to say I forgot a lot but the new version, with more gamification and a lot of new features is amazingly complete. (a bit stressful sometimes with the timing)"
"I really like duolingo, but I am starting to think that maybe it won't teach me the whole language, because you don't really progress much, you only learn about 200 words in your first section. One thing, also the stories don't really teach you anything, so I don't know why they put it into duolingo in the first place. Don't get me wrong it's great. But I think it could do with a tiny bit more improvement. Also once you start a course there is no going back, I accedentally chose Welsh."
"Duolingo is a pretty good learning tool, my only suggestions are that they teach more useful and simple conversion at first like ""Hey, how are you"" and ""I'm doing fine, and you?"" for simple back and forth conversion. Also I'd suggest that they add more complex languages such as Thai and Cantonese, I really wanna learn Thai and with the tools in Duolingo it wouldn't be difficult if only they had that language as an option :( anyways, pretty good app"
"Great app! Pace is not too difficult for me to quit, but also not too easy to learn anything. Using Duolingo, I have made great progress in my Russian (language I learned 30 years ago), and in Italian (I'm learning it for the first. Free version is not overloaded with advertising, and I use it without in-app purchases. In fact, I am so satisfied with the way it works, that I will start paying a membership fee next month - simply to show gratitude to Duolingo team, for the great work they do!"
"I love this app. The way it is structured to learn is really good for many learning styles. There are pictures, matching games, and speech portions so if you are a visual learn or prefer to read it has a good blend. The free version is wonderful if you're okay with a few ads but I am definitely considering trying the paid version for all the added benefits it has."
"Progression is WAY WAY WAY too slow sometimes. It should let me skip levels in a unit. However, Duolingo has been very helpful in getting me better at Spanish and more familiar with the language. BUT I also don't like how we don't have the option most of the time to type out the translations instead of clicking/tapping the little blocks with the words. I hate it, ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M DOING IT ON PC. I prefer typing and I want for there to be ALWAYS the option to type. PLEASE ADD THAT!!!"
"Worked great for about a month, then progress stopped being recorded in one of my languages and my streak stopped being maintained despite completing lessons. Given I can't progress in one language, and the game-ification for motivation isn't working, what's the point in using the app over other language courses? I pay for super duolingo, and submitted a bug report yesterday but received an automated message and no solutions. 2 stars because I can progress in one language with no streak."
"Great app to learn new languages on! Has many motivational fetures that keep you going! One thing I noticed that isn't quite what I wanted is that they don't actually teach you what endings apply to what sircumstances for romance languages (or i just haven't gotten there yet), so you have to pay extra attention to the patterns of when and where they use specific endings."
"I have been using super (subscription) dor a year now and have been enjoying using the app. I do have a complaint though, there seems to be a glitch with speaking exercises, it does not recognise words sometimes even though im pronouncing it exactly as instructed , even cutting me off mid sentence sometimes with a 'lets move on' even though I am still mid sentence. Sometimes i am done saying the sentence and it will just lag and only after some time ask if I would like to try again. FRUSTRATING!"
"It doesn't really teach you grammar. I'm trying to learn German, for example, and keep losing hearts because I don't know which nouns are masculine and which are feminine. Duolingo touches on this briefly in the first lesson you learn, but they never teach you how to distinguish between masculine and feminine words for yourself. This makes it a guessing game of whether you need to use der, die, das, ein ,eine, etc. It's quite frustrating. It is good for extending your vocabulary, though."
"Love the app. The widget feature was what has been helping me keep on my streak.... but now, I am kind of annoyed by the widget not regularly updating the images as often as it used to. About two weeks ago, I have to click and open the app in order to have the image update. And it is kind of demotivating."
it's amazing I love it soo much. it's such a great app I 100% recommend. the ads are what you want them to be they are like every 5 to 10to even 20 mins and it really did help me learn a little of Japanese🇯🇵. although I don't believe any app of any kind can teach like to speak any language fluently without someone talking to you that is experienced. I think this is an amazing app. and if you're looking to download it.. YOU 100% SHOULD! ! ✨(I hope this helped)
"I have had this app for over 2 years and have learned a lot but lately there has been a lot of updates which have caused a lot of glitching and has also caused me to not reap the benefits that I usually get from practice. For instance, I literally just tried to do my daily lessons and was not rewarded when it said I was supposed to. My time is wasted because the app freezes on constantly & I do not recommend downloading this app. It is terrible and it's a far cry from what it used to be."
"It is very ANNOYING & FRUSTRATING when trying to speak Spanish on this App as the language speaker constantly speaks over you when you are speaking !!!@#£%., Plus when speaking, the App is either locking up or the App cannot hear your speech !!!##%& This makes the whole process very stressful !!!!!, whereas it should be an enjoyable experience. This needs to be sorted out."
"This program is really great for reviewing or learning a language, particularly if you already speak a similar one of have some recollection from high school. For example, I think I would struggle with the way they present French verbs if I only new English, but they are easy to pick up with limited introduction since I speak Spanish and some Portuguese."
When starting out Duolingo (Italian> it keeps you at the SAME questions for way too long. To try and skip ahead with quiz almost works but they throw in one word you don't know & it keeps you there . I have answered the same questions 100 times successfully & then they continue with the same questions even as level up. makes me nott want to log on. However when I did French at a higher level it moved faster. and gave NEW knowledge and challenged me Instead of wasting my time .
"It's a good app, but alone I couldn't fully speak the language. I would use Duolingo and learn how to order something, but also need a bit more help outside the app not need English subtitles. My Italian is going well and this Duo teaches me faster than my school does. So good job, and maybe add more complex sentences to work with like ""I'm so tired of this stupid math work. Let me call my bestie."" So we can use them irl lol. 9/10"
"As of writing this review, I have a 1080 day streak running. I've used this app to help with Spanish classes, brush up on Polish, and more recently, learning Japanese. The app is great at reviewing grammar and its applications within sentences, but I found it to be tedious when it comes to vocabulary learning. The lessons are very repetitive, and you go a while before learning new vocab. I would absolutely recommend using this app with other vocab learning apps, like Anki."
Update: I used this app daily for almost two years and made a lot of progress but after the last update no matter how much progress I make the next day it kicks me back to a previous level. I have done the same lessons over again for over a week. If the next update doesn't fix it I will stop using this app. Too bad because I really liked it when it worked I love this app! I have made so much progress in just 15-30 minutes a day!
"I like the app, but I do think that it's not good on it's own. I do French in school so I use the app to learn some extra vocab and help me with some revision, but I see people learning languages on here unsupported and I just don't know if that would work. The pronunciation features are very buggy and just not the best. But I do like the leaderboard and streak aspects to it. Also it's not the nicest user experience if you're not willing to pay for Super."
This really helps me get motivated with everything. The freaking notifications are f****** hilarious. I love this app. It really helps me get motivated during the day if I start getting motivated then. I would get motivated to do other stuffand this makes me very happy. I'm very happy that this app exist. And I want it to keep producting and keep adding on to how grad it already is. But there is a bit of a problem with the ADS for me. It's just a little bit too much. Other than that this is nice
"I just love it when they cha ge the course most of the way through. Sat down to finish a level review and the thing is asking me vocabulary and grammer I've never seen before. Ai content is bad. Voice lines are mid at best. I wanted to stick it out and finish the course but since they've pulled the rug on me here I'm not keen on that. There are better apps, I'd reccomment Hello Chinese if you're looking at Mandarin."
"I have the paid version, learning Japanese & Chinese. It's quite good overall but I think there are too many revision exercises that are based on speed and not enough to entrench the vocabularies. There are no speaking exercises in Japanese (up to S2) and in Chinese, there are quite a few voice / speaking exercises that do not work. There are no writting exercises. Some exercises don't make sense e.g. a 6 years old university student?"
"The lessons are good but the app has bugs in either its design or implementation. It keeps sending me backwards to repeat the same lessons, claiming that it's ""synched my progress to new and improved content."" I wouldn't mind if the content was new but it's exactly the same."
"- Very well though through, nice to use. Many addictive mechanics used to make you continue (xp, league, legendary chest, gem systems) - waste of time, waaaaay too many repetitive basic sentences all the way to the end. - I'd love more theory before practice (approx none currently). - The free version is unusable: excessive 'gem', 'heart' dependency, frequent ads... - A few bugs, especially on a spotty connection (eg. lags on lesson validation, or even crash and lesson not marked as done)"
"Good for practicing vocab, of you don't pay the explanations are lacking and in order to learn the language you must do a significant amount of outside research just to understand the lessons and why things are said a certain way. Additionally, there are many glitches, for instance the ""spend gems to get more double XP"" feature is broken, and several times my 5th early bird chest and night owl chests just glitch and don't give double XP, which is frustrating since the leagues motivate me."
"it is so fun I've been doing it for almost 2 years (nonstop, but I've used a ton of streak freezes on days where I didn't have internet access) and it goes well with my Spanish class. it feels like it reinforces the things I learn in class and let's me learn a few extra things as well. recommended to anybody who is taking Spanish in school especially"
"This is the best app ever! it's helping me with my learning and I ace my tests in school in Japanese! I hope other people download this app because it helps you learn certain languages. like Spanish, Japanese, French, Chinese, etc. it is a really good source if you are preparing for travel, just want to understand a friend, or for job improvement! I love Duolingo because it makes learning fun!"
"This app would be better if you could choose to reuse/customize parts of the lessons. Like the character writing practice, or choosing which vocab you need help on, etc. It tries to tell you which words/things you need help on, but the lessons often skip vocab you learned earlier until the very end, so the program doesnt have mistakes on record to flag those words. The lessons are too likely to just randomly repeat stuff, and not go over everything evenly"
"Good idea and realisation, if you want to pick up a new language, you can try this app first, it will give you a taste of the language and give you basic vocabulary which will be useful if you decide to take a proper course later. Since recently there is a problem with the app where the app freezes once the timer runs out during rapid review. Once this is fixed I will give the app 5 stars."
"I really like learning languages but it's sometimes unfair to me lately. It's because I am literally Deaf and I often see that they try to get me to practice any audio lessons. I wish that there's a switch ""no"" on all audio lessons/tasks for deaf learners to pick for future lessons. It's really annoying to see them trying to get me to practice it."
"this is an amazing app that let's you learn many languages but it doesn't have all of them. For example, my mother language, tamil is not in it. It even has fictional languages but it does not have the Minecraft enchantment table language. Also, the prices for duolingo premium is too expensive, at least in my opinion. Everything else is amazing though."
"This app is amazing for anyone to learn the language they desire but the thing is the older version was better than this where the topics were divided into 6 levels or so and each level had a crown. That version was, according to me, best. And we could practice the previous lessons but that option is not available anymore in this newer version I'm dissapointed with this new version"
"I removed 4 stars for one very aggravating reason. I've been working on my Chinese course for awhile, I was well into unit 3. After updating, the units have been completely changed. Most of what I learned is gone & the units I completed are full of things that I never learned. Essentially, I'm starting over from the beginning since the units are full of things I haven't actually learned. Not cool & not making me want to continue using this app. I'm so glad I didn't cave and pay for Super..."
"Great for reading. Only good for speaking if you repeat everything, repeat everything! Not great for writing. Helps with listening but it has silly characters with silly accents. Even so, I'm learning new vocab and grammar and hopefully I'm retaining at least some of it."
"Used for Japanese. Pros: - Easy to use - Generally customizable - Good variety of minigames Cons: - Relies on subscription model to be fun - Uses AI for prompt generation, causing me to doubt the legitimacy of the lessons - Highly addictive with leaderboard and streaks, can be intrusive if notifications are left on Overall, a mixed bag."
"The app makes learning a new language fun. The only thing I don't like is that there is a heart system which you have 5 hearts and everytime you get a question wrong you lose a heart. If you lose all your hearts you can do a lesson to gain one back or use 250 diamonds to gain all back. If you don't want to have 5 hearts you could get Super Duolingo which gives you infinite hearts, but I think the subscription is pretty expensive for learning a language. The rest of the app is great though."
"I've been using Duolingo to learn some French before an upcoming trip to French Polynesia. I feel like I am learning practical vocabulary and grammar. However, it's hard to say if using Duolingo will actually help me in the real world. we'll see. It is fun either way and I like the game like aspects that keep me motivated to practice."
"I love Duolingo. It's a slow pace, but i am actually getting somewhere with a language i have tried to learn for a long time. You have to get past the first 5 units and then it starts comming together. Relax, have fun, learn-forget-learn, try not to burn out. Remember, this is supposed to be fun and enjoyable. It takes a couple years of daily study to learn a language."
"The free version is very helpful, but it does have an ad between every lesson, which can get a bit annoying. However, I've been practicing so much that they just gave me 3 days Plus. I didn't even have to put in my card info. You definitely need to put in practice with real speakers, but I've used this app since 2016 and always found it to be engaging and educational."
"Great app for learning a new language. I use it to study Japanese and it's a great help in vocabulary retention and Kanji. The only problem I have encountered is that the app does not teach grammar properly - no instructions on verb and adjective conjugation, so one would need an extra resource outside of the app. Other than that, I like it for the reason I mentioned above. 😊"
"It's a good app and makes it super easy to learn a language but constantly sends you super annoying notifications if you don't practice for a couple days like... "" Duo thinks your ignoring him!"" etc. and doesn't let you play for a while if you run out of gems. It also, shows you too many ads of Super Duolingo which can get irritating. However, it's a good app ,but could use improvement."
"It's a very good app for learning languages. But, there are so many things you have to pay money for. It definitely would have gotten 5 if you didn't have to pay for SO MUCH. Also, there definitely are some significantly better apps for learning languages. Those other apps wouldn't cost money. But for some things I like about this app are that you get streaks and when you get a high streak (I have a 44 day streak) you feel like you have to do another lesson to continue your streak! That's It!"
"This app would be useful if it didn't cram 60 second long unskipable adds in-between each session. Then it has the balls to try and guiltrip you into doing lessons by sending extremely annoying notifications and reminders telling you how bad you are for not dedicating 23 hours a day to practice whatever langue you want to learn. This app is bait, they make the free experience extremely miserable in hopes to get you to pay for the upgraded version."
"*Update - 18 Feb 2024: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix the stupid bug that is causing the app to not detect voice properly. This issue started since 2 updates ago. I had to change my review because like many others, I learned a lot in the beginning, but the app suddenly updates and changes the course material in the midst of a lesson. The hints aren't as accurate as they used to be, so phrasing the context of a sentence becomes more difficult. Lithuanian is also not offered in this app, why?"
"Update: for over a month now, half the ads freeze. Have to close the app & start over. Very frustrating, need attention. ••• Helpful but a bit broken. It drops whole days when I *know* I've done the day's lesson, setting me back & using up freezes to artificially maintain continuity. That being said, I am learning, which is the point. But it's frustrating when every few days the app is like ""Nah, you're imagining things; you didn't do yesterday's lesson,"" and you KNOW you did."
"Enjoyable learning experience. Worst part is completing a lesson earlier in the day is not counted if you start a lesson from a reminder notification later in the day. So, there is only a record of one lesson completed, not two. Has happened many times now, so getting super frustrating. Ads annoying but tolerable. Would be great if they added the Maori language."
"Duolingo has chronic mistakes in the English translation as for example saying ""use to"" instead of USED TO in Spanish lessons learning past tense. Also, the use of coger instead of tomar, constantly using isn't, won't, didn't instead of is not, will not, did not etc. Also there is no way to review old topics because the app keeps erasing and changing what unit I'm on and no clue what's coming up. The ""tips"" never explain new things very well. I use this app to supplement my learning Spanish."
"Love the app, found more time to learn so I jumped back on. I wish that every xp boost had an option to collect in shop, and that there weren't so many, because most of the time I don't want to practice for 30 minutes, and sometimes I do. I can't stand when I get one and I feel obligated to have to learn so that it doesn't go to waste"
"I've now finished all 3 sections of Haitian Kreyòl and am on the refresher section. I've learned about 600 words total. It is the same few sentences ad nauseum! I just use predictive text to complete the typed ones. When I do a Legendary level that incorporates some of the other material, I find I can't remember it because it's not being reviewed. Duolingo has mass fired translators and is now AI generated. There are SO MANY mistakes. Duolingo uses us as beta testers to catch these mistakes."
"It's a good enough app to learn, but there are certainly some problems. It would tell me I wasn't pronouncing certain words right, even when I got a *native speaker* to say those exact words. And there are challenges - especially ""Matching Madness"" - that will be timed, yet rely heavily on vocabulary the app hasn't even given yet. Also the difference in their premium and standard services is like night and day."
"Duolingo is good for learning a language, but only if you also spend your time watching shows, reading books, and listening to music in that language. It is recommended that you do this anyway, but the speed you learn the language will be faster without wasting your time on an app that priorities money over base knowledge."
Pretty good when using the paid version! The free version is unfortunately hampered by unskippable ads after every single lesson (so every (2-5 minutes) and not being able to make more than 5 mistakes without spending the in-app currency. The ads are not as prominent the first week or so of using the app.
"I'm not a big fan, I paid for a year so i am doing a lesson every day but find it will take forever to learn on this app. The app really doesn't ""teach""much. There is a tiny ""guide"" at each section you have to locate & review yourself but other than that its the same sentences & content with no explanation or theory, over & over. It will keep bugging you about rankings & has annoying race against the clock type activities. Mondly is infinitely better."
"it's an amazing app and it's been doing so well until recently, it keeps saying ""you're offline"" meanwhile I'm not and I'm not having issues with other apps just this app. what can I do about it? please, rectify it. edit: I just tried uninstalling and reinstalling and now I can't even log in due to the same error. what a bummer, it was a nice app Edit: it's been three months and the app is still not working, it keeps saying I'm offline. I wrote a mail to them back in January and no response."
"I am here on google store after having duolingo in my phone for 6 months to tell that duolingo is slowly deteriorating. It has been asking for premium for everything and without it, it has limited our actions to just doing as scheduled and it is a bit less fun now. I hope this doesn't become like other apps such as spotify. But, still I am giving this app 4 stars because it is actually good for learning."
"The course I am following changed order whilst I was part way through but the words learnt did not update. Too much time is spent teaching names when more time could be spent on learning grammar. No explanations for common mistakes: genders, pluralisations, word order and so on. It definitely feels like the language with lower uses are an after thought."
"Duolingo is great, especially the fact there's a free version. But it's SERIOUSLY lacking in features. How there isn't a flash card section to easily practice vocabulary is mind blowing to me. Apparently this was discussed as a feature and never executed, quite dissapointing really."
"Everything was fine until the app had an update two days ago. My previous lessons had been all but wiped clean, and then when I retook said lessons, I was given completely new terms, phrases, and sentences that I've never learned. It didn't even reset the lessons to the actual learning points. Basically said, ""Hey, we've updated your lessons, have fun learning!!"" But all my data is gone!!!!"
"Within 10 minutes I was reminded why I ditched this app 10 years ago. Useless, repetitive lessons about letters. No sense of progress or excitement. I said I want to use it for travel so why am I being forced to match sounds to single letters over and over and over again? Tried French before and all it seemed to want to teach me was ""The children are eating rice."" Brilliant. That'll come in handy for a multitude of situations. Ignorance is preferable to this garbage."
"Excellent experience. I'm learning Russian and it ""was"" going good. But now ever since Unit 3 and the end of Unit 2 it has been spitting out billions of new words and putting them in hard combinations. It's good practice but now I have a lack of motivation because of it. Before I was 10-15 minutes per day. Now I am 5 minutes per day. Beside that it is perfect 👌."
"the app used to be really good but they have removed so many features! you can't see the questions others have asked for similar mistakes. if there's a concept you don't understand there isn't anywhere in the app to look up more information. you used to be able to have ai chats in the language for practice that they removed. when there is a drop down for word selections, they don't tell you why there are multiple options underneath and there is no tutorials that explain it ahead of time."
"gamified language learning to make learning languages less onerous. it's obsession over daily practice gets a little annoying (especially when you're a busy adult), but streak freezes ease that somewhat. I think the $70 annual membership to avoid ads is worth it. It's a nice alternative to learn something rather than doom-scrolling Facebook."
"Frustrating since my last update. The app keeps telling me I'm offline when I'm not. Somehow, in my offline state I can still redo former levels. It's frustrating. Then there's the shutting off when I'm in the middle of a class. Please fix this."
"So far, the app itself seems great. But the ads are intrusive, sudden, and LOUD. Really ruins the whole experience. Quiet down your ads, or default them to mute, and maybe I'll add more stars. The app also advances through screens without me hitting the ""continue"" button."
"It's fun to play the Duolingo games and it helped me learn vocabulary and some basic sentence structures. However, after one year, I still find it challenging to integrate everything I've learned and bring what I've learned into everyday conversation, so I think there's room for improvement"
"Super cool way to learn a new language. (Update 2024) I honestly dislike the guilt trip notifications. It was funny at first, but I seriously avoided the app for a long period of time because of it. I paid for a year, thinking I'd go for another year but have changed my mind. Another thing is that some of the characters in the app are gay. Which is fine, but it's pushed everywhere on the news, on social media, in movies, and in government. I can't even escape it in a language app."
"This is a great tool for learning a language, but (1) there are far too many ads (2) after the most recent update, it takes a long time to load up a lesson (3) not all languages have the same level of depth (eg, Greek has less than Spanish), and not all languages are available to non English speakers (eg, you can't learn French from Greek or vice versa). Having used it for over a year, I would say it's worse than it was a year ago - more ads, more bits to do (daily and weekly tasks take up time)"
"I really enjoyed using this app and found it to be a great learning experience for learning French. Now I'm in the position where I've been scammed out of 56€, I was offered two weeks free super duo and told I'd be notified two days before these two weeks ended (which I wasnt) then next thing I know without notification I was charged for a whole year plan, not a month. I tried to get a refund through the Google Play Store only hours after I was charged but they declined my refund, scam"
"It's pretty cool when you get that sudden realization that you are beginning to understand another language, but after more than 3 years of everday app use, I have become disgusted with the app. They say you can learn a language in just ten minutes a day (for twenty years maybe), that isn't what I hate about it. It has many errors in the language hints and doesn't explain why you may have gotten an answer to a lesson wrong. I also dislike the competitive environment. I would not subscribe to it!"
"Despite some issues, which I found unacceptable to the point of saying that I wouldn't join, I am surprised by how much Spanish I have learned, and so, I most definitely am joining. Duolingo's user account/settings section terrible, & having to pay for certain tests, I don't like at all. Also, I get a free language learning app through my local library, and many words and phrases on that app are different than on this app, which I gather is due to different dialects, but it is very frustrating."
"It's mostly a good app. I knocked off a point for the times where they are too fixed on a specific answer without accounting for other words that can be used in Spanish. I know the language, but don't know what specific wording they want typed out. Other times, they won't accept a direct translation from the English grammar they use in the question. Both Spanish and English make use of a gerund, i.e. ""eating"" is ""comiendo"" in Spanish."
"seems to no learn as fast as I was hoping to, especially in hearing. maybe it's just me. The ads sometimes take me to unsafe apps according to my Norton. Also, why don't you have ads in the language I'm studying. Af/er two years, I can have a basic conversation. But your Ads! One long minute of boring ad that is loud. Gime me a break!"
"This app makes me weirdly anxious. Ad revenue is obviously understandable to fund free education, but for a serious learner it is too restrictive unless you get a paid subscription. As lessons get more complex, each phrase holds more potential for several mistakes that feel traumatically like life or d€ath. You have to quit your progress and break that momentum by having to stop and regain hearts. It is putting me off of wanting to invest the time and focus if it is just going to be go-stop."
"This is a very magnificent app for building health habits of daily learning, with focus on languages! The choices of languages to learn is good for now, even though they still have to include so many other local languages and popular dialects of languages! One of the few improvements I want to find there is the interaction with community, which will help in language immersion for learners, and this way they can grow in their learning! This way the material will diverse and more interesting!"
"I loved this app until the most recent update. Specifically the voice changes between a male & female for different words in the same sentence. After getting to a 640 day streak, I can't stand it & will not renew my premium subscription. As someone with learning & processing challenges, this just makes it stressful instead of fun."
"I love how fun this app makes learning interesting I love all the reminders and everything, but the language that I'm learning is something that I have picked a few words in and I can connect simple sentences. what we're learning is okay but I feel like it's informal, there are grammatical errors that needs to be fixed I'm learning Zulu and the Zulu that is spoken on the ground is somewhat different"
"simple mistakes, even repeated ones, count as much as important ones. I am dyslexic. I often confuse e-i, and some other spelling errors because I don't see them!! correctly. Duo sees them as intentional mistakes. Otherwise, it's a great way to begin to learn a language"
"Doulingo needs more useful information. There's barely any normal sentences that I could use in a conversation. They normally put the weirdest sentences for you to type out or to say. This app doesn't even teach you how to count 1-10, or give you the option to try to learn the pronunciation of the words depending on what language you're learning. I wouldn't really recommend this app for learning a language. 😕"
"It's very good for a free app, and the advertising is tolerable etc. The encouragement from the owl is fun, they've clearly put some effort into this. I've been learning Japanese and it's mostly good, but is a bit limited in real life applications. Also I've been doing it for over 600 days and it still hasn't covered counting properly? It's only sporadically sort of briefly done numbers to tell time or ask if that doctor is 3 years old... 😅"
"I like doing maths on Duolingo as I struggle with maths a lot and Duolingo helps me but I think it is very unfair as I have to use a completely different phone to do it on. So I think that you should have the same features on android. I also think that you should maybe add extra hearts, not everyone has enough money for super Duolingo and to learn properly you have to make mistakes. The practice option could be improved if by practicing when you lose hearts you can gain more than five."
"This app has become increasingly more money hungry, as it hides features behind pay walls and ups the amount of adds to the point where I have to close and reopen the app after every lesson if I don't want an ad. The problem is, when I close and reopen the app, it doesn't save my streak or say I earned any exp. So even when I have done 10+ lessons in the past few days, the leader board says I only earned 28 exp. It also hasn't said I did any lessons in the past 2 days."
"generally very good though it moves pretty rapidly and the revision options aren't great, so progress feels rapid but retention is poor. having to be creative in ways of going back over stuff, but I use it as an accompaniment to structured taught lessons - and it's generally pretty fun too."
"This is a great app that helps you learn languages effectively! I love that I am determined to keep my streak going and that means I do my learning every day. It is designed to help you keep your streak going so it gives you ""freezes"" to use so you can skip a day every now and then without losing your streak. I love this app. I am at a 23 day streak with French and counting."
"I think this is probably the best language learning app there is. It helps build you're knowledge fast and covers many languages. However, it's no substitute for in person tutoring or immersion. For example, I use duolingo to practice my Italian and instead teaching the conjugation patterns of verbs, it teaches each conjugation of the verb as a separate word which is a very inefficient way to study language. It also incentivizes paying which is not something most people want from an app."
"I love this app, but I don't love how they reorganize lessons when you are mid unit. It may add more to the program, and I'm all about improvement, but it really makes it difficult when previous units that you ""completed"" now have vocabulary and concepts that you never learned and you have to try and double back to learn them."
"It's a good app for non-paying subscribers. There are some features available only to paying subscribers. However, I think it is still worth your time. One con that might annoy you if you're a native English speaker (perhaps also if you're learning English as a foreign language, although I can't speak to that) is the number of comma splices the app includes in answers or questions. In my opinion, that's unacceptable and a bad example for language learners. (Former foreign language teacher here.)"
"I really enjoy the app. My son and I are both both learning French and the Duo Lingo keeps him motivated is awesome . Good repetition, introduces new words and phrases in an intuitive manner. I sometimes have an issue with hearing slight differences, ano or agno. Phonetic spelling on request would be a suggestion Thanks for a very solid app"
Duolingo updated the course yet again and shuffled around all my progress but yet again they failed to teach me these words and phrasesthat apparently I'm supposed to know. So now there are even more questions that I don't understand but are popping up in the leader board challenges and other exercises. Extremely demotivating and annoying. I'm reconsidering my Super subscription.
"I really love learning languages with Duo. There is much variety so that it doesn't get boring. The only reason that I didn't put 5 stars is because I would like there to be an option to choose, for example, European Spanish or Mexican Spanish. In the end it seems to teach both because I have seen multiple words for some things, but as I travel to Mexico often for work, it would be nice to tailor the learning in that way. All that being said, I can't think of an easier, more fun way to learn"
"It isn't truely motivating to keep learning your language day after day. It gets boring after a while. And I find that it doesn't actually help too much when trying to learn a language, I think that their methods aren't the best or just doesn't work well. It is good for a free app, and I doubt that premium would make the experience that much better. It is good that aren't ads every single lesson and that you can learn offline. Meh, it barely works. Y'know, if you are desperate. It is fine......"
The app is getting worse and worse. The score still doesn't always update. My progress isn't always stored - I've done some lessons 3 times! DUOLINGO DON'T RESPOND TO FEEDBACK! I paid for the app for a year. I don't think I'll be paying again! The only English is American English so in some cases I have to translate from French to US English to UK English! Seems like they care more about money than valuing language.
"So far so good, the learning is step by step so far it's constant and not also. You would learn bits and pieces of the letters and characters for the language your learning and them go over the words/ phases that googs alone with them then you move on. If you feel like you need to move on ahead or go over the words/ phases, you can go at your own pace or go day by day and compete with others across the world. rating 4 stars because nothing is perfect and always need improvement."
"The app doesn't allow you to practice to earn hearts so you can complete your lessons. The ads to purchase super Duolingo are pushed constantly and I feel like they purposely give you errors to make you lose your hearts so you'll be tempted to purchase their program without ads and unlimited hearts. On several occasions I have chosen the correct answer and I receive an error. Then when I put the answer they showed, I'm given another error with my original answer as the correct one."
"It is AWESOME the perfect app to learn any language. It's safe, easy, and fun 😊. The new setup is great. Before it was so much now you can see that you don't have too much. I was always worried that I wouldn't understand someone who spoke fluent Spanish because I am learning but they added a lesson where it was just talking as if it were a real person. This shows me I would be able to understand. Doulingo is a confidence builder and a fun learning game. If I could rate it higher I would. 🥳😍💯"
"Successive updates have made this app more, rather than less, unstable on my Nokia. It is failing more often than not to apply the double points, and there are issues with the word bank disappearing. Quite often the story doesn't open quickly or at all in level 7."
"I have tried many language apps and programs and Duolingo has impressed me. I know over 5 languages already and I feel it has never been as easy and affordable to learn a new one. The app is very user friendly, and it tailors exercises in a way that is fun to do. You also feel part of a community of learners, which makes learning motivating even if you are by yourself. I love the product design and investing on the monthly fee is also well worth it when compared when other options out there"
"great lessons that slowly introduce more language with good repetition, and I love that you can see the spelling and hear proper pronunciations. can practice hearing, reading, and writing. I don't like you are penalized for getting something wrong. if you are struggling or make mistakes you lose hearts and sometimes can't move forward that day because you made 4 mistakes...which I think is kind of silly. obviously you probably need more practice"
"Actually it's a nice app, but the french course isn't as good as it should be. For context I am learning french my 6th year, currently having B2, so I use Duolingo to revise and learn new vocabulary. First of all the course offers few possibilities of answers. I can't pass certain levels, because only one answer is correct even though there are 3 different ways of answering in real life. The second thing is, I noticed some vocabulary being outdated/less in use than the not-accepted synonym."
"The app is is good BUT there are two reasons I take out 3 stars: The voice recognition has issues to understand very short phrases, in my case, when it ask a sequence of 3 numbers in german, or the word Euro. AND, during timed events, when the clock expires there is a pop-up message that will offer you to buy extra time using gems, the buy button is where the Next Question button is, it swaps, it makes it look scummy, like if the devs want you to click on it by mistake, and the purchase is final"
"This app is really great, but currently, I'm having some difficulty to progress as the app may bug When I finish a level, the progress is not immediately displayed and sometimes we have to pass the level again and again to see the progress. Please solve this issue. Thank you ♥️"
"very good app to learn a new language. im learning quick and efficiently. you get daily reminders to do lessons. the lessons go from typing in the language, speaking, hearing and matching etc. you can also have a friends list to compare with your friends or contact you know. very good feedback. keep up the great work Duolingo, and all the best with the languages. Ich lieben Duolingo!"
"I've been using this app since July 2021. I really loved it's experience and the way they teach you through very basic to intermediate level. The user interface makes it very easy for a totally new person to understand. I would have given a more star if it has a bit more than intermediate knowledge, but for a beginner it's just awesome...!!!"
"I like this app for learning Italian. However it doesn't seem to detect my microphone for speaking exercises which is on and for which I have given permission to be used. This has not been a problem using Duolingo in the past so idk why it is now, and I've always had an Android. Please fix. Also grammar lessons in between would be helpful to understand WHY it's like this."
"Duo is a good tool to learn a language. I've improved my sentence structures. The problem is that not enough grammar is taught or given in the hints to help with the lesson ahead. Why has the discussion button been removed, which was very helpful when I wasn't understanding the sentences & other uses explained why I was getting it wrong, invaluable. All duo does is mark the sentence in red with no explanation. Can't get gems anymore either, you use to watch an ad for them, disappointing 😕"
"I really want the app to have more English learning material, e.g, grammar tips, pronunciation tips/rules e.g., for the letter 's' (in the middle or at the end of a word) as either 'z'-sound or 's'-sound. !Please pay attention on what I would most like you to add: The use of the International Phonetic Alphabet for the pronunciation of the sounds / words in every dialogue / text in the app will be absolutely useful for the learners. It will greatly help the correct pronunciation."
"Well, I mean, it's a great app, and I've learned so much Japanese on it! But, why does it send u Sooooooooooo many notifications? My phone is starting to glitch because of it and every time I set my phone to not disturb me at night, It still dings! And the button on my phone to turn the notifications on apps of isn't working properly, so plz fix this!"
"I never review products so this is a first. duo has helped me learn and use German to communicate somewhat well. although there are some things that I wish duo would teach within the first unit. it is a solid experience that I have suggested to others who want to learn languages. Good app, I wish there was a dictionary for researching and studying words for future reference."
"one of the few apps I would not mind paying a subscription for , I traded in scrolling endlessly on different social media apps to learning a new language . Personally it fits my learning style to a T and is super easy to understand. I would recommend to others wanting to learn a new language or just explore something new and different."
"I'm currently learning Italian with a 79-day streak. Duolingo is a perfect app for learning a language. However, the notifications do tend to get annoying but it does get me to do a lesson. It's funner when you do it with your friends because it'll give you quests and you and your friend can complete them to get extra gems and you can give your friend gifts too."
"I'm back after several years away and I've gotta say, the improvements they've made are exactly what I wanted when I stopped using the app. I use it for Japanese and they now include explanations for grammar and guides for how to write the characters. things I had to try to work out for myself the first time. highly recommend!"
I find it difficult to learn when the answers are often filled in for me. It mainly occurs when i am asked to translate. It was not happening in the intro. Only started happening in level 1. Also some of the question is covered over by the multiple choice answers if the question is longer than 1 line. Im reluctant to move forward as I am struggling to learn with this app. Please could you respond to this bug as I have reported it many times now. Also keeps freezing up!
"good bite-sized lessons, and they definitely hold you accountable! I personally enjoy the little applause for reaching a goal, and they make sure to congratulate you. I really would recommend this app! the only problem I could see is that it is made for more traveling purposes, so if you were looking to be fluent and to have a very wide range of vocabulary, then it might be limited for you. but still, all things aside, I do recommend!"
"I have been using it for a long time (with Duolingo Plus nearly 3 years), but now that I have the opportunity to use my knowledge seems like if I didn't knew anything, all the grammar explanation for small languages is almost forgotten in the app, the only thing that could change this point is a more detailed grammar explanation section, like the one that appears up top every path, besides this huge disadvantage the whole app is good for learning languages."
"This app is amazing! There is not very many adds and I can learn offline. I can have many courses and I actually enjoy learning. I was a little frustrated about the hearts but not to much. It is really fun and helped me learn a lot. I am learning Japanese, French, and a few others and honestly have never gotten so far in Japanese. I have never seen an app as good as this and haven't had any major issues. I am having significant progress and feel confident so I really suggest this for learning."
"The app asked me to review them... So here it is. The lessons work and you do learn the language, but you'll want to blow your brains out because of the constant ads to buy ""Super Duolingo"". Then you have the stupid heart system they use that basically screws you from learning anymore because you're just too frustrated to continue with the lesson. I have no clue who's idea it was to force this Super Duolingo down your throat for more then the cost of Netflix, but it's not working."
"His app can be good to help you practise a language. Don't think that this would teach you the language, it will not. You need a Basic knowledge to benifit from using it. Not all languages are equal, I find French good, but German is really poor, there is no help or guidance. It appears as though the French language course has been created by a team that have America English in their 2nd language, the English is frequently quite odd / poor."
"Great app for learning languages with just a couple of exceptions: I'm learning Spanish, and unfortunately, Duolingo fails to explain some rules or exception to rules. For example: clase is feminine, but restaurante is masculine. The only way you'll learn this is by failing it in a test question... and if it was the question that causes you to fail the test, too bad. Due to not being taught by a human, I've reached a learning block and Duo doesn't recognize it."
"Great app to pair with other language learning resources or for beginners. Gets regular updates but can be lacking in features for some languages. Worth getting premium when it's discounted, particularly for those who want to speed through lessons and review later. Currently having issues with the app not giving me different vocabulary to review in the words tab, only the same set over and over."
"It doesn't recognize me correctly pronouncing a phrase even when I know I'm saying it correctly. Also, I guess because some of it is AI, the words sound identical (French). They need to make pural and single words more clear. It's fun otherwise. I'm not sure how much I'm really learning but I'm going to keep with it"
"I've been learning Japanese, and so far it's been a really fun experience. Even if you're really busy it's usually pretty easy to find time even for just one lesson because they're so short, and the way you gradually build up knowledge of terms and grammar seems to me to be pretty well designed, plus the leaderboards and rewards add a little extra motivation and make it really fun. Definitely recommend"
"It was great, i wouldve gave a 5 star review but they updated the course on a language, which added characters that are completely out of my level, and it was extremely confusing and i dont want to restart my progress. I wish there was an option to choose if I wanted the new course or not."
"Duolingo is a great app for learning a language and has great potential, but it gets a bit repetitive after a while, and most children these days don't have a long attention spam so they'd get bored quick while hence making learning much harder or even none at all suggestions I have 1. You can learn similar words first if possible and/or letters in the alphabet (if it is in another writing system) 2. Save streaks during famous holidays, cause it's harder to learn whole with your family on Xmas."
"If you care about the game experience (and I'm guessing you do or you wouldn't have picked this app), don't use Android. I've been steadily struggling to keep up in leagues with the same level of effort. From several weeks of top 3 diamond down to Obsidian and dropped again. Then someone pointed out you get less xp on each lesson on Android than iOS. I double checked on my iPad, I can get 20-30xp/lesson there with no bonus active. Same lesson, same time on my Android phone gets me 10xp."
"It's ok, but it seems to rely on participation awards and shaming, which was pretty off-putting for me. I'd prefer it was more positive without being patronizing. It seems intent on pointing out mistakes and weaknesses, which often aren't weaknesses in reality (how do they come up with them?) And sometimes the mistakes are a clumsy thumb. I wish I liked it more."
this app is really good for learning the basics of a new language. but the narration is very annoying. it's impossible to listen to music while using the app. every time i start on a new question the narration will also decrease the volume of my music. they should have at least a function to disable the narration
"You are amazinggg. Yeah. Eres asombrosoo!!!! Your concept of the streak have kept me hooked to this app. Its helping me use my time so much better. Im having so much fun and learning alott a the same time. And the rewards you give after each lesson are just amazing. The coding, the game like structure and the notifications, the casualness and user friendliness of duolingo is just amazing. It has changed my life."
"Duolingo has massively helped me to start learning italian by doing little bits every day. Obviously you cant expect to be fluent off of repeating a few sentences a day on an app but it helps me to grasp the meaning of words and formulate sentences which has much enhanced my learning, and I will say that I would have been a useless tourist on my recent italy trip without it. Thank you to the brilliant minds behind a simple tool to help you learn without much fuss :)"
"I absolutely love this app for my German studies! I bought super Duolingo and it's been very helpful and fun! Although, me and my roommate are both studying German and we agree it would be very helpful if Match Madness included der/das/die in the matches. We both struggle with memorizing the articles and it would be a cool feature to add in. Thanks for an awesome app!"
"Not too bad, but there are e few annoying things. For example the constant urges to buy yourself time, or streak freezes or whatever. Plus, I wanted to make my profile private, but nobody bothered to answer my requests about how to do that. Anyway, in general, not too bad and in any case better than doing nothing, I guess."
"This app makes it so easy to learn another language. SERIOUSLY. The different types of exercises makes your brain think in different ways & keeps it more interesting than something that's repetitive. I'm typically a visual learner and this has a good mix, it's great."
"the previous educational format was more of wide view. learners could go back review a lesson their choice, repeat them to remember, for the their fluency advancement. or before starting a lesson they could study logical grammatical base. people could see story titles to review that helped their needs. where is the wide scenery? current format has a pipeview base. i think someone has messed up big time."
"Love the app but nobody replies to emails, customer service is absolutely appalling which is disappointing especially when you are paying for the super subscription. I want to be able to add my son so he can enjoy it too. Unfortunately I think once my subscription is up, I will try one of the other language apps!"
"There's not enough examples in the exercises, the same sentences are repeating too often. There's hardly any flexibility allowed in answers. An answer may be correct, but it is considered false, because the author of the question didn't bother to put alternatives into possible input options. Narrow-minded and lazy!"
"If you think you can seriously learn a language with this app better look further. I use it as a supplement to an irl course or I would long abandon it. Gamification works to a certain extent, but at the amount of effort this program requires to be useful you would be better off with a textbook. It's simultaneously too much repetitiveness and not enough practice, my settings for Japanese keep glitching and turning on romaji. Plus abundance of artificial audio instead of real native speakers."
"It's too good for learning new languages. People , who want to go for holidays in a foreign country they can easily learn the languages in a short period of time. The most cutest character in this app is duo , He will help you in any problem. So, for learning new languages I would prefer Duolingo app . It is not helpful for me but also for many people."
"Duolingo: Fun, Accessible, But Room to Grow Duolingo's bite-sized lessons and gamification kept me engaged in learning (language). The vast language selection is amazing, and its free version opens doors for all. I especially appreciate the focus on practical skills and the supportive community. However, more speaking/listening practice and expansion into complex grammar for advanced learners would be fantastic. Integrating with other platforms could create a more well-rounded experience."
"Really good except I'm encountering an issue which doesn't allow me to progress to the next lesson without restarting the app, and it's really bothering me having to restart every lesson. Every time I finish, it just prompts the same level again and I'm not sure why, it didn't always do this but now it's every time."
"Reiterating, because this keeps happening. Wow. Don't pay for gems. Just did the match challenge, and EVERY word in the first set was a word I hadn't yet learned, and the words take too long to come back when you make a match. Then, more words I've not yet learned. Thus, strategically causing a loss to your gems, and if you paid, then you lost money as well. Stop doing these kinds of things, Duo! Good grief, why do I even have to say that?"
"Very good app! I would give it five stars if there was a way we could select a specific unit to practice, and also if it had a way of teaching conjugation rules. I'm learning Finnish, and I'm still confused with conjugating verbs and such. It would also be 5 stars if it wasn't giving me words I haven't learned at all. In my Italian course, I've had to match the English with the Italian word. It gave me plate, hat, and another word I didn't know. Please fix this Duo! 🙏"
"The best app in the world! I love Duo and it's ""lingo"" aspect and here's why. A good thing about it is that you can learn any language you want for free. Another fantastic feature is game-like learning and the strike. They really give me huge sense of achievement. The only problem are, of course, hearts. It's shame that you can do so little in free version daily. All in all, I would recommend the app to literally everyone. Even people not interested in languages can learn one here quite well! 5!"
"I enjoy it very much but it has bugs, one I constantly running is really demotivating, it does not count my completed lessons to the monthly badge, for example I had 33 lessons done in January, I wanted the badge so I started to go down with the lessons finished 7 and it's counting 35 on the monthly badge...disappointing and frustrating because it's not the first time when I notice this."
As im using this app more and more I keep finding some features being annoying for example when I'm typing an answer on my keyboard on timed lessons sometimes the prompt for buying a timer boost pops up closing my keyboard and me miss-clicking to buy boosts even though I did not want to.. There also could be some explanations to why a word changes in a sentence now its just learning words. BUT over all its a great app to get started with most of the languages
"First off, I dislike that they removed the ability to read forum questions that have been asked about the lessons. Also, I would like to also learn Chinese, but it relies on teaching the symbols too much. I have no desire to write it. Please give the ability to learn pinyin instead. I wish there was a better lesson at the beginning of each section. Like, give me a list of the words I'm going to learn. Or, an explanation of reflexive verbs, for example, instead of just expecting I get it."
my daughter got me into this. I was leaning Spanish for years and started to give up. but this app is bringing it all back but best off all teaching me words I have never seen. so beautifully diverse avatars and just an all round comfortable interface. just brilliant. it has adds but it's free so ads are no proble for such a life skill like learning a new language. this is so much fun 😊
"It's okay, but for some reason, it keeps taking away the xp points that I have, and it doesn't get any when I do new lessons. I've done multiple lessons and I'm still in the demotion zone at 40 xp. This is just really annoying. (Edit: ... Okay, so it started working right after I left the review so I guess I'll add like three more stars to the rating.)"
"A really great app for language learning! I do wish there was some customization with the monthly quests, mine keeps becoming a larger and larger amount and it's a bit overwhelming. I'd like to have some control on that."
"It teaches you new words every day, but if you are new to learning Spanish or another language. I think they should give a wider range of words for each category and much more study time to memorize the words, there spelling, translatiing from English to Spanish and how to speak that language fluently! It all takes good time so the lessons will also!"
"Definitely 4 stars! I'm having a few problems. 1) I started Japanese while learning German and it worked for a day but then deleted my Japanese course. 2) something is up with my streak. It told me my streak was at 83 on the widget, 82 in the app, and 81 in the notifications. 3) there is something odd with the hearts, it keeps saying I have 1 and then I mess something up and makese quit but then still says I have 1 left. Thank you for your time"
"Hey guys, I think this app is great and also with some weird stuff, but the case is that I've already ended my course yesterday and it doesn't looks like it has an end, should I play and compete in this game eternally? I don't think so, it's a little bit unpractical, beside it took me 5gb of storage to do it, I don't have storage enough to play to the end of times; it could be better, like all normal game that come to an real end, however nice if you need to learn and don't have another option."
"Best free app for learning vocabulary. Finish first section to ublock story section with dialogues. I learn Spanish, Italian, French and Russian and this is great for learning new words and basic grammar. Minus for putting a lot of similar question but with different gender/plural/the un which is really frustrating. Ask same question instead of similar ones with added one letter l"
Lately the review section in the paid version has greatly decreased in quality. The same training session repeats over and over again until the next day. The good thing about the the paid version is that you could conveniently train all passed levels in one place. Now it's just one level and the same phrases over and over again.
The app is really good. Has lots of fun languages to learn. I love that you make the app actually fun to learn so it keeps you active. I also love that you guys added a leader board to show your progress and other people's aswell. The app also requires you to focus while learning so you won't lose hearts so you can continue moving on to each section. When all your five hearts are gone you're are going to need to practice to make sure you're really understanding the topic and I love that.
We've been paid members for a couple years now and we LOVE Duolingo!! Each of us has learned way more using Duolingo than we ever did in school learning the same languages. One of the coolest things to me is that I've been able to also learn just some basics in several different languages to kind of get a feel for them. Their methods work and actually make learning a language fun. The option to be competitive is also a big plus. Excellent!!
Duolingo is a game changer when it comes to learning a new language. I struggled with learning Spanish back in highschool but this clicks with me. I think the difference is that it's like playing a game with levels and challenges and a social media aspect to it. so it doesn't feel like memorizing phrases and words but more of a game that just happens to teach you another language
"UPDATE: Still no response from the developer. App still not working - strongly suggest you don't use this app. App randomly froze and wouldn't let me in. Tried deleting/reinstalling it, got asked to sign in and it's saying there's an error. If I reset my password it says there's no account registered with my email despite still getting emails telling me to keep up the good work. Have lost my streak and the effort I put in - emailed the support team but heard nothing. Terrible service"
"This app is great for getting some vocabulary, and you kind of can figure some grammar from trial and error. But the daily refresh section has gone down to hell in recent months, with the app recommending to ""practice your weak words"" over and over again for months on end. I don't know if the issue is the same in the paid version."
"You can actually learn a lot from this app even if you're just a toddler cuz its really fun with the animations and different games/ways of learning. The lives are good even without infinite hearts to challenge those who can't and don't wanna buy the premium! I also like how it doesn't pressure you that much even if you choose everyday learning, and just reminds you to take a lesson in one day and not exactly 24 hours or you'll lose the streak. Overall gg, and educational for all ages."
"Terrible, I get y'all need to make money, but the heart system that is in place makes it almost impossible to learn a language at a pace you would like, and punishes you on new lessons and material you don't know yet, as well as taking 4 hours PER HEART to get back, one of the WORST language learning platforms out there, used to be good Edit: multiple years later, if I could give it even lower I would, app still trying it's hardest to make it impossible for you to actually learn the language"
"The app is well polished and fun. However, more content should be added to existing courses. Italian only has A1 level, which allows for a very limited understanding of the language but that's it. Also, I would like to see the type and scale of the friend's quest configurable by the user and rewards given accordingly."
"1)You give the double experience and then take it, and it doesn't count. It happens too often! 2) I often push ""can't speak/hear"" button by mistake! And I can't cancel it! Add the ""cancel"" button to overturn the changes! 3)The feedback on pronunciation would be great with the wrong sounds outlined"
"After you guys laid off a bunch of staff and started using AI I've been noticing really bad lessons for French, the way it wants me to write sentences either often sound awkward or there's something not right for between both the English and French portions. Also for lessons where we chose the words from the word bank in the correct order, it's irritating that there will always be 1 extra word thrown into the bank that isn't meant to be used and is wrong, this will really throw ppl off."
Great app to start with but as i move further up the levels there is lot of written questions what isnt very helpful for learning if you have dyslexia like myself its put. Me off the app and learning i would like to see more spoken and put the letter in the correct place exercises. Or maybe put an accessible option on the app.
"I really don't feel like I'm learning anything. most the time I'm getting answers right with process of elimination not because i know the answers. As someone who has a loose understanding of Spanish coming into this, I feel like the app makes no effort to actually teach you why things are said the way they are. it only looks for if you know your vocabulary and not much more"
"Duo is more of a resource, it's helpful to learn a language if you know the basics or have another source to learn from. On a negative note the app will give you a limited window to earn double points which will make the leader board challenging because it's on their time not when I'm able to. (Not everyone keeps the same schedule)"
"I absolutely love it and would give it a five star rating except for one thing. It keeps saying I'm offline, even when I'm not. My network would be fine, with very other app would be working, but Duolingo would say I'm offline and I'd lose access to my lessons. I've ruined my streak because of this problem. I dunno how to fix it"
"For the most part, it's a wonderful app. I have had some issues with typing in words in the Navajo language that should have been accepted but weren't, mainly when I have to type an 'o' with an ogonek accent. I generally have to copy and paste it when needed since I can't type it using the English Samsung keyboard. Also, there are no listening exercises after the first few lessons which makes it difficult to learn pronunciation. I am learning Navajo so this may not apply to other languages."
"Decided to come back to learning Japanese on this app after taking a pretty long break from it, and this «coming back» experience was very frustrating and confusing: the app greeted me with «welcome back», but offered no help with getting back on track. I tried starting from the very first lesson that was accessible to me, but I couldn't «retake» that lesson, only «review», so, having forgotten a hefty part of what I've previously learned, I kept making mistakes and quickly ran out of «hearts»."
"Whilst I generally like Duolingo the constant changes are frustrating. The latest change where they've disabled word suggestion on gboard is really frustrating. It makes swiping to write words very awkward, and wastes a lot of time when I make typos on my small phone keyboard. I have a seven year streak but am considering ditching Duolingo as this change has made it more about being able to type accurately than know the language."
"It crashes very often. For example, I cannot start an app, or sometimes a lesson. Or what's even more frustrating, when I finish a lesson, it gets stuck on loading and I have to start all over again. Do something with this. And by the way, I'm learning Spanish and why on earth would you remove from course such an important form as ""vosotros"" which us CONSTANTLY used in Spain??"
"When you get something wrong, they don't offer an explanation why it was wrong or explain the grammar behind it. They're basically like, no. Try again. I don't like that there's no lessons, they just throw new stuff at you repeatedly and figure it'll eventually stick. This method takes so much longer than if we actually understood how the language works."
"It is a great app, and my friend does it now. It is the BEST app to use if you're traveling or just for fun. I love that you have a streak and freeze to protect it. Right now I have a 78-day streak, and I am up to section 2 unit 2. Also, I love the friend quests to earn rewards. Whoever started duolingo is a genius. I highly recommend you download this app RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!"
It would be better if the introduction of new word meanings wasn't done in a multiple choice style question. I don't know the language and I'm only being given a 25% chance to get it right. Statistically im only going to be able to learn 6 words before i used up my daily fails. Even with another romantic language in my arsenal there are differences that you have to just guess at. I've lost motivation to participate in an app that punishes you for not knowing something you're trying to learn.
"Quite good, but it will sometimes say that trousers is a incorrect translation, because you didn't put pants. Also, if you make a mistake, it won't always tell you why you're incorrect, just what the correct answer is, and sometimes you need an explanation. For example, if it was to do with the order of words. Also, the 5 hearts thing is very annoying, and you have to pay to have unlimited hearts. But, it has helped me to learn French, and is quite effective, if you can get around these problems"
"The lessons are made exciting and very informative; all in a stress-free and relaxed atmosphere in order to aid even the most beginner type Learner in understanding, hearing, matching, and speaking the language with fun and ease. I especially love the characters' emojis as a means to both complement and encourage the Learner every time they score a correct point on each lesson exercise. Definitely helps the Learner to stay motivated with every passing progress."
"While I can appreciate the effectiveness of game-type elements for keeping people regularly engaging with language learning, there are some aspects of how they actually teach a language that are sub-par. Main examples that come to mind are a lack of explanation of grammatical concepts or language nuances in general, and especially the lack of articles when drilling vocab in gendered languages. Also, their corrections of mistakes with ambiguous translations are often misleading."
"Terrible update. I was in Duolingo premium learning French, and after the update the voice recognition has gone to the dogs. It's like the AI was trained on screaming goats, it doesn't recognize anything as correct. Moreover, the match puzzles now hang in between, so even if I know the translation I can't match, increasing my time arbitrarily. Sometimes, my 2XP boosts suddenly disappear after I claim them."
I love the app but it keeps glitching and the widget tells me I've done my lesson for the day at like 10pm (i live on a very atypical sleep schedule) and then i go to do the next days lesson at like 3am and it says I've used a streak freeze. Has happened at least 10 times. Really frustrating. I mean I do lessons regularly enough that I'm not without a streak freeze for long but still annoying that the widget glitching is messing up my streak because I depend on it to tell me if I'm okay!
"duolingo is wonderful for learning a new language but there is the problem of the paid subscription. I believe if an app is a learning app they should pay a life fee and have it forever instead of like £60 a year I think. also the heart system they use is ok as unlike other apps you don't just wait an hour and regenerate hearts, you earn them by practicing"
"I'm learning Italian, and as someone who has learned Italian before, the very first introductory unit is horrifying. I've gotten exercises where I've had to repeat names - what exactly am I learning in those? I've also gotten exercises where I've had to repeat ""Ah"" - why? What's the point? The lessons are horribly put together and if you really, truly want to learn another language to a point where you can speak it, understand it and understand how it works, there are much better ways than this."
This is by far the best learning app for learning a different language. It helps me in all the ways that I need to learn. I would always start with other apps but this one keeps me reminded with the streaks. I really enjoy this app because it's also very fun while learning. I lastly also love that Duolingo is helping kids and adults all around the world 🌎❤️
"generally I like the app and it helps me motivate to learn despite busy life.yet I find some part of interface unintuively placed but most of all I'm missing the lessons - regular readings and explanations, beside learning by choosing. it's also better for total beginners and quite boring and discouraging if you already know some language and whant to skill up. podcast app is only for iPhone! and nag screens about the app are diaplayed on Android - what is it? free apple add?"
"Makes learning fun and easy, but I wish they would explain grammatical rules instead of leaving you to figure it out through trial and error. I would also enjoy using a vocabulary practice feature. Also, they insist upon using homosexual references and situations, which isn't typically enjoyable for people who don't subscribe to those beliefs, and shouldn't be included if children also use this app."
It's good and amazing like you are learning a language by an app which seems to be a game but the only problem I am facing is the limited hearts like I am not a teenager or an adult who could take a subscription on their own and my parents would never allow me to do so and also their are ads like after every lesson. So I would recommend the old version not the new version.
"App itself, technically speaking, is perfect, everything is well thought of. However, content which is the most important thing leaves a lot to be desired... For example, Korean class is not very good. Legendary level covers new words and phrases which are not included in regular practice. Regular practice is just repetition without many new sentences. Fine, if that's the concept, but what about the new words? Also, too many different sentences in just one go. I cannot memorize all of that."
"It is fun, it keeps moving, but at a pace you set for yourself. Learning German for me, will take time. But I find this app is just right as it's enjoyable and you make it what you want by challenging yourself to the next steps. I look forward to each day, either for new challenges, or simply going over what I have learned. I like the cartoon figures and after a while you learn how to utilize more things within the Dulingo App. I am actually surprised by the diversity and how it works."
"The app works on Montessori learning , so it is very fun and playful . But , as everything has , it has a tiny problem 😐 . I entered the amethyst league, which is far, so I decided to stop. I disabled the leagues, and after a couple of days , I GOT a NOTIFICATION THAT I WAS DEMOTED TO THE EMERALD LEAGUE . And also I love daily my animations. Pls 🙏 fix these. It is really annoying, but in rest , the app enters in 5🌟 categories. Upgrade the app🎖🔝!!!"
"It's really good for learning languages, I'm learning gaelic but considering the spelling is always not what it seems and there's a lot less gaelic letters than English it's kinda confusing when they throw in random names, as well as the fact the audio is very low quality and seems poorly recorded when listening to words for putting a sentence together. Aside from that really bugging me, I enjoy the app."
"Changing my review AGAIN. I'm learning Japanese, and the Kanji section is incredibly small after going through some of it. There are also too many repeat lessons in Kanji. And looking at how much is left, there is no way there's enough Kanji to properly learn the language, unless you're stuffing 90% of the Kanji in latter half of the lessons. On top of this, since the AI usage started, I'm seeing a lot more borrowed Japanese words than native ones. A few good changes, but also many more bad ones"
"I think that sometimes the app isn't clear about the prizes when you complet the lessons. Also, I saw that sometimes I wrote the answer or the sentences in the correct way and the app don't accept my text. However, I enjoy learning new vocabulary and differents ways when I want to say something. That's funny and very important for me."
The way the app has been designed to feel like it's a game is entirely the reason why I am able to come back each day and achieve the daily goals... Also the characters and personalities they have created are entertaining and enjoyable😊 and it is much easier to progress and learn when you have friends involved to keep each other motivated!
"I did give this App a 5* review. I had a family subscription so had paid them for their premium package. Then I had to replace my phone. When I tried to access my account I realized, after days of trying, that I must have used a capital letter in my email address. Therefore, no way to access any emails they send if you have forgotten your password. You cannot auto change your username/email, like other memberships. Duolingo has very bad customer service & I've lost my money. BEWARE!"
"App has become increasingly worse at recognizing speech. Have to yell and still app doesn't recognize me. I don't know how the mechanics of app become worse after years and increased funding from ipo but the whole speech issue stops it from being a 5 star app. Also de nada in spanish translates into, ""it's nothing,"" not, ""you're welcome."" Teach me the literal language not the interpretation. And if you teach the interpretation then it should be along side the literal meaning."
"It's a good app, but it really bums me out that there's no minority languages, like Slovak. I downloaded it mostly to help my friends learn english, but they can't because the Slovak language isn't there. And literally no other apps have it either. And I'm sure this is a big problem with many other small countries in the world with practically unknown languages."
"A very motivating app with many different kinds of experience. Duolingo trains speaking, hearing, writing and more. These different experiences help you learn the language faster. There are also many unique languages available but you need to learn some in English wich is not important to native speakers but to people who are learning English and another language."
It's fine to get a basic on pronunciation but if you're going to try learning a language with a very different grammar structure to English you're eventually going to stall out on here and have to find another source to learn. Throwing sentences at people with no context on why one works differently than another is not helpful at the end of the day.
My lessons don't get added to my streak unless I click through all the continue buttons to make it back to the home screen after the lesson. Previously you could access discussions on individual questions and someone will have explained the grammar on answers I didn't understand. Now I keep getting the same questiions wrong because I don't understand what rules apply. There were also better guides at the start of each level explaining the grammar.
"Easy to use and the gamification is good to keep you interested. However this app has a lot of adds which really slows down my learning and makes me feel like I'm actually wasting my time as a lot of time is spent watching adds and instead of learning. An add after every 1 minute lesson is far, far too much. There is another Spanish app called memrise which is not as ""gamey"" but is far better for actually learning Spanish."
"I think I found an interim solution. Instead of having a cache of all the sentences studied since the beginning, perhaps compiling the sentences studied in a particular lesson and showing them at the end of that particular lesson(without storing the information longterm) would be the way to go. I believe in addition to the list of words in the review section, this would suffice for the time being. I applaud your efforts towards creating an ideal platform to help people learn new languages. Danke"
"I got tricked by the UI design during a match challenge when the time ran out. Half the screen gets covered by a prompt, and if you were tapping to select the matches and it pops up, it is simply !ding! thanks for spending your gems. Add at least 1 second delay before selections can be made for match challenge boost purchase when time runs out. 💯 Absolutely inept design."
"pretty good at what it's supposed to do. however, it's buggy quite often, and the shop prices are outlandish. Also the update removed your ability to see your progress towards achievements and the longest streak , highest level achieved etc is off cuz how would I get the achievement if it says my highest level wrong ? There's better apps. You almost have to have pro"
"it's great honestly. I've been learning Korean and it's been helping me. It's not like they force you to watch ads every 5 seconds,most of the time you can choose whether you get an ad or not. And instead of having to wait for days for hearts,you can practice for them! it's a great learning game/app for any age if willing to learn more of a language!"
"I like recent changes to the platform and have updated my review in light of this. Still buggy in places, the speech input is inaccurate sometimes, and it would be nice if you could select learning a language in another language without changing the setting globally on the app. Also, each time on the path should give you an option to test forward. The next section is too far, and each time is so tedious that day learners will get bored reiterating same words. But otherwise, this app is improved."
"I would normally give it more but it's been having bugs and their help center is non existent. Just automated responses and websites that are not working. I've been trying to use ""speak"" lesson. Duo tells me to turn on mic (it's already on). I click ""turn on"" either way and nothing happens"
"Overall nice app but sometimes gives you practise without actually teaching you something previously. For example, the app doesn't give you a comprehensive explanation or a tutorial on case conjugations, and then you get a practise in which you have to use case conjugation. Then when you get it wrong you lose a life. E.g. Fill in the blank: В ____ много животных (зоопарк, зоопарка, зоопарке). Exactly how is a person trying to learn Russian supposed to know this without any tutoring? Guessing?"
it's an amazing app that makes me learn so many symbols and letters in many countries but I wish they could have added basics and how it sounds rather then learning a word really fast without even knowing the basic sound and alphabets of the language but I'm still very impressed and comfortable with the app its an app where you could improve better and I know a lot because of this!! just hope it takes my advicee
I love this little cute owl! 🦉🟢 So cute 🥰 and encourages me to learn Spanish and more. Very immersive in learning languages and encourages you to keep going. The stories and context is funny and also important in learning the language. The badges and limited time achievements give you motivation to collect them all! Currently have a 191 day streak!
"Came here to give a detailed explanation, I'll just leave this here - Duolingo, your ""explanation"" within the app, how the paid version will be charged, is totally different than what happens on Play Store. You trick people into thinking they will be charged monthly, but once you come to the payment part, you get billed with the annual price. Shameful and against good advertisement practice! Should I say, scam!"
"I've been using Duolingo for years and have learned a good deal of Spanish. So, yes, I recommend this app. That being said, I am occasionally frustrated by the lack of explanations for some things that I don't understand. There is also a problem with being overly encouraged to do a lot of lessons in a day, to a point where it's becoming more about quantity of exercises than quality of learning. I think I'm starting to plateau in learning as a result."
"I started learning Japanese last month, I do at least one session per day and I find that it works. I have only missed 3 days in that month and I'm usually rubbish at being consistent, so I believe speaking for myself the app has also motivated me to keep up with the extra points and badges you get when you are on a continuous strike. I only use the free version so far but I have started considering getting the one you pay for soon."
"Downgrade to one star until the glitches are fixed. The newest update is the worst. The app freezes when I try opening it, and if I click on a lesson to begin, it doesn't open right away. I have to click on it a few times before it starts. Wish I could uninstall this update and go back to the way it was."
"As an app Duolingo is fantastic *IF* you can access it. As a paid subscriber, I have no customer service support after getting logged out of the app. There is no phone number. Support emails go unanswered. Automated emails provide broken links that do not load. I am locked into paying $120 annually for an app I cannot access and have no customer support. I have been trying for two months to get a hold of someone with no response."
"4.5 stars good language app, understandably ad driven, learning is relatively easy and I can see that it teaches more than simple a few words or phrases but rather builds a strong language base around sentence structure and otherwise. learning is game-i-fied which appeals to my competitive nature. generally compelling lessons and lessons designed around mistakes seem like a great way to improve on repeated errors."
"It just keeps getting worse and worse. Now they messed up my progress when refreshing the course, and to top that, they removed community discussions, so now I'm always lost in my course with no help whatsoever. I feels like the app is just getting worse. They keep adding features that don't really help with the learning, and removing the ones that do."
"İ would like to take up family plan for Duolingo super, but İ don't want to pay over £80 at once. I would like to pay monthly and be able to cancel at any time. As it is I rather not have Duolingo super family plan simply for that reason and İ have many friends who think this same way. Please add this option and we will subscribe! ☺️✨"
"Duolingo is the perfect way to learn another language. It has all the resources needed for free, and is challenging enough to make you want to continue learning. The only think that I don't like is that there are only 5 hearts. I think there should be one that is not visible-like life support. But it is overall a wonderful game and learning resources."
"pros and cons with this one folks. Fun novelty of language exercises, curriculum is different depending on when you log in. Problematically if you log in during a more experimental approach to learning you can have a real hard time learning the language. Aggressive push notifications, and long ads can make it a little lame, but for a free language tool you could certainly do worse."
4 stars.. i do absolutely love it and am learning super quick. i have paid for the full version.. which i absolutely recommend. however.. i give 4 stars out of 5 only because you are tossed into sentences with new words without working on the words to learn first which for me makes it a bit difficult. i would love to have the words with photos or even words with the meanings to match before being tossed into sentences so i can learn them before having to try to understand the sentence first.
"Japanese: This app is good for a couple of weeks, but it forces everyone to learn to read hiragana and katakana. Very quickly (unit 3) romanized pronunciation begins to disappear, which makes it impossible for users who only want to practice listening, because you cant do the exercises without being able to read the prompt in hiragana/katakana. I filed bug reports but never got any help from developers."
Leagues were great to keep me getting more lessons in a day than bare minimum. Now without doing lighting rounds on some other language (that has bare minimum lessons done to unlock it) 24/7 it's nearly impossible to stay in diamond with all the people that have nothing better to do or are straight up botting. Good luck without premium. Please change it back to the way it was. Rewarding us for doing old lessons.
"Though a little glitchy at times, it is pretty easy and enjoyable to learn some other languages. Also it is completely free and kind of relaxing and calm when I do it. This app is one of the greater ones on the app store and I can't understand why there are low reviews. But overall great for learning other languages fast and easily!"
"I can learn Irish anytime, anywhere for as little or as long as I want. It teaches me how to read it, say it, hear it, and surprisingly WRITE it too! There's no timer, so I can go as fast or as slow as I need to. I can go back to previous lessons and do ""practice"" lessons to earn more hearts. I get to share my progress on Facebook. It's a really cool app. I'm glad I chose to download it. I might end up subscribing. We'll see."
"There is no longer a button to access comments. This would make up for some of the wrong translations or grammar, by seeing corrections. It's gone now and we're stuck with the garbage. For the Japanese module, there are still many issues in regards to the translations. More voice acted stories would be wonderful."
Great app but sometimes the translations are wrong (I'm a native speaker of the language my child is learning) 2. There doesn't appear to be any way to turn off in-app purchases. My son has accidentally bought gems 4 times now as he just clicks on it. At the very least make it a 2-3 stage process to purchase. He's 6. 3. There is no customer service when things go wrong.
"Great way to learn foreign languages. Set up like a game. Removing one star because too often, when you win double XP (points) for the next 15 minutes, it doesn't register for the first lesson. I can normally get through two or three lessons in fifteen minutes and this bug cuts into that significantly."
"I've loved using Duolingo for the last several years, I always recommend it. But for some reason as of late, the widget doesn't update to remind me to do a lesson. I've lost 3-4 freezes just to keep my streak going because of it. Is there a bug in the widget? I've removed it from my home screen and readded it, but to no avail."
Was several units in when Duolingo changed the course content without warning and arbitrary out me on a different unit with a load of words and phrases not previously covered. I had to set up a new account and start again to cover everything. This was for Scots Gaelic. Duolingo constantly wants you to pay for premium but why would I when they make such drastic changes without warning.
Pretty good with regards to the basics but you pretty much hit a brick wall due to the lack of or no speaking exercises. I've been learning greek for 7 months now and I do pretty well through the exercises. I went to cyprus and gave them a phrase I'd learnt. The waitress didn't understand me and said my pronunciation was off. Speaking is a huge part of learning a language and the most fulfilling part as it feels the hours spent learning are paying off! Sort it out duolingo
"I grew up speaking Spanish, having learned it as a 2nd language, beginning at age 8. Since finishing high school over 50 years ago, I've not had anyone to speak it with, so I've forgotten a lot. Some is coming back to me since using this app. Many of the words for things are different from the ones I'd learned. Some are words I'd never encountered before. I learned this app teaches Spanish as from Spain. Being in Texas, I'd learned Mexican Spanish. This is expanding my Spanish vocabulary MUCHO!"
The App continually fails to open and gets stuck on one screen. The only way to get it to open is to restart my phone. This is becoming more frequent to the point I'm considering getting rid of the App all together. Had this not been an issue I may have scored it higher.
"I personally like dualingo because of the learning experience you get and the way they teach you is amazing. For instance there is:hearing the words,matching the words,writing the words and picking the spelling of the words.Also I can't forget that they give you so many options for different languages! I think everyone who wants to learn different languages should download dualingo now! I also rated dualingo a 5 star🤗For Greta service too!"
The app is good for learning basic words and hearing the language spoken. However there are problems. 1) It says there is a keyboard to translate into the language but it's next to impossible to get it to show up. 2) They expect you to just pick up on different verb tenses without ever teaching them.
Duolingo is very good with it's tactics to learning a language I'm learning Korean and how it's built like. However there is a minor problem for me BC sometimes when U do a speaking exercise where it requires U to speak once you are done speaking it just keeps pending and it won't go through and then I have to quite all me progress and start again BC the lesson won't continue unless the speaking exercise stops pending and I'm telling U it won't go through. Duo pls remove them bugs from this app.
"So far, this app is amazing. The actual language learning part is pretty good, but the thing I love most is the fact that it only teaches you actual words that you would need. I used to learn Spanish at school, and my teacher taught me the most useless stuff imaginable. Now with this, I learnt really good phrases like how to order food or get a taxi. The only slight problem is that I did miss my streak one time and I live in constant fear of a particular green owl 'coming for a friendly chat'."
"Such a fun and easy way to learn languages for free. Especially for beginners like me who is learning European languages. Even without premium subscription, ads do not get in the way much. Keeps me wanting to take multiple lessons in one go while I have the time. So far it has been worthwhile spending time with this app as it never bores."
"Could have been a good app, has good content, but the devs are too greed, the free version have way to much ads and the limited hearts hinders learning. If it's a learning app, why keep you from studying with this limited heart system? Those things make the app very counterproductive, because to much time is spent in the repetitive lessons and wasted in 30 seconds ads every two minutes. Also, it is unnecessary woke. I just wanted to study without being hit by woke propaganda inside the lessons."
"It's fun and makes learning fairly easy, but there isn't a coherency to the lessons like in a textbook. You learn a lot of random words in each lesson. Not like a greeting conversation and then family words and food words, etc, like in school, but random. Still, I'm trying to trust the process that I can speak sentences in 6 months with some conversation. I'll update again later if it does work out."
"When I started to learn High Valyrian, I had never learned a language before. I am of Hispanic descent, hoping one day to learn Spanish and Latin. But after the multiple updates, and the lack of being able to learn the grammar, essential for learning a language. In none months I completed the HV course. But they changed it 3 times. Learning on discord that they had a guide but removed it. There are grammar rules that some of us need to learn. Why make an app for just gamers."
"The app doesn't contain feedback od courses, only for bugs. I started learning latin. The course is very short and focused on modern America, which is kind of frustrating to learn new words that are renamed american cities. Also, some sentences are non-sense, and loose the correct form in Latin. Also, translating names shouldn't be a thing, I lost perfect lesson for not translating Stephanus to Stephane and Marcus to Marce."
"In 35 days with Duolingo, I've transformed daily language learning into a fun, engaging habit. Its user-friendly interface and gamified approach kept me motivated, significantly improving my vocabulary and grammar. While it's just the beginning of my language journey, Duolingo has been an excellent starting point. Highly recommend for anyone looking to dive into a new language."
"Very good algorithm for learning a language. It's important to keep at the lessons. One star deducted for the frequent intrusion of ads, although you can get rid of them by subscribing. I hesitate to subscribe because it turns into an ongoing subscription that you would then have to remember to cancel when no longer needed. The interface is interesting and amusing!"
"I did Japanese for three years in school, I've picked up Duolingo now to stay sharp on all those things I learnt. While it isn't taught in the same order, I can see myself remembering more vocabulary words than I ever did in school, I highly recommend. A suggestion for Duolingo, I know it's a bit different to spoken language but I can't find any apps on Australian Sign Language which I found helpful, adding it to your list would be an untapped market and greatly appreciated."
"Super cool app, but idk what's up with the notifications because it feels like it sometimes just doesn't notify me. Plus I just did the 4 exercises to redeem my lost streak due to the missing notifications. It said I successfully got it back and then started showing me an ad. Since I was done anyway I closed the app and surprise surprise, I didn't get my streak back. Thanks for nothing."
"Very good for a free app. Could use some flexibility with certain languages. I understand that strict adherance to the conventions of one dialect is better for new learners, but it can be a hindrance for people just looking to practice a language they already know, when the particular dialect they speak is unavailable."
"It's been months that the practice button gives me the same set of sentences to translate, no change, no reply to my feedback, no hint that anyone has received it and no way to submit a bug report because both the browser and the mobile version just show an error message when I try to send one. Is anyone still running this app?"
"Why do I need to go though the exercise over and over again in different Units of a Section? This diminishes my enthusiasm of learning a new language. It begins to become boring and demotivating. With the best of intentions, I'd like to request the product owners of Super Duolingo to not make a user with somewhat above average grasping capabilities, suffer through the same exercises over and over again."
"it's a fun way to learn, but like in a pay to play kind of way. there is an advertisement after every lesson regardless of whether it took 1 min or 10 and half of the adds are to pay for duolingo in order to skip adds. the non duolingo adds are skippable after about 5 seconds. However, the duolingo adds are unskippable and 30 seconds long amd every other advertisement. im convinced their business model is trying to annoy you into either paying for or dropping the app."
"I'm really happy to use this app. This is good learning platform for students as well as other native people. I'm requesting you that to Introduce English with English interface. That's very useful for us and many people including me, we're seeking for it! I hope your team will take this request as a consideration.Thank you!"
"Duolingo is free and I enjoy that, the ads are well placed at the end of the lessons. Sometimes I feel that the lesson should not be pushed to the hard difficulty in the middle of a lesson or the entire lesson be moved to hard. other than that most of my complaints have already been fixed. it's an actual free app and you can talk to other people while using it!"
"very good application. does not cover vosotros as it is more angled towards South America. Not enough grammar lessons embedded, which can make it difficult to know why your answer was incorrect. Takes too long to progress. You have to use it together with something that is faster and gives you more grammar rules. I use the Complete Spanish podcast from Mihalis Eleftheriou using his Language Transfer method for speed, and Coffe Break Español to add vosotros."
"This is certainly a good starting point for learning a language. It would be nice to be able to go over old lessons to really catch the words or to have the same level with different sentences to become more confident about the sound and structure of the sentences. I liked it enough to buy the pro version for$60. I tried to get the family duolingo so that I could invite my wife but, bizarrely, it refused to let her join. I wrote an enquiry but no reply as yet. I still regard it as a good app."
It's a great app to learn the basics of a language but the further you get the worse it becomes. The start is very fun but nowadays I've been recieving many bugs were my duolingo shortcut was showing that I had completed my daily lesson but then at 10 oclock I get a notification that the streak is about to end. Please fix this thank you.
"App is designed to scam users out of coins. I just lost over 1800 coins during Match Madness without any notification of cost. The app has very poor computer generated audio which often does match native speakers. Hints are often either wrong or non-existent. I used this app for almost a years with no progress whatsoever. I don't recommend buying the app, or use it to learn language. The app oriented for gaming, not learning"
"I already know a bit of Spanish, and having a bit of time on my hands, I decided to give Duolingo a go. I am extremely pleased I did because my Spanish has improved dramatically. This method of learning has really reinforced that which l already knew, but more importantly, is advancing my understanding, vocabulary, and accuracy of the language. Give it a go."
"Love this app! The lessons combined reading, speaking, and listening. The progression is natural in terms of level for Korean, and there is emphasis put on learning syntax through repetitive sentence styles. I use this app in conjunction with a vocabulary app and I have progressed 6 levels in 2 weeks. It's also excellent for review for advanced Korean students."
"It went from feeling like the Duolingo owl was going to show up at my house and beat me, to being quite an enjoyable gamified version of learning a language. It's really helping, and whilst the adverts are many, most let you skip after a few seconds, and they're not as annoying as some other apps."
"Easy to follow but uses American English, and is teaching me Mexican Spanish - would be good to have the choice for Spain Spanish (there is a difference, and not one mention of Pounds £ or Euros but lots of dollars, pesos!) and don't correct my English (it's football not soccer, get over it). Occasionally says words & have to guess spelling because never been shown before, assume this is to train the ear but being failed rather than taught is an odd way to do it. And too many Duo ads for premium"
I've tried other apps like babble and wasn't a fan. This is fantastic. Some things are a bit lame but for the most part it's a solid way to learn a new language. lots of choices as well. would be nice if you could choose the type of session as a side deal like the word matching and thats what you do for your unlocked word library or whatever type you enjoy and learn best to.
"I'm learning Japanese, but if you want to know why you get an exercise wrong, look elsewhere (like Busuu). The ""guidebook"" gives you key phrases (to memorize) rather than actual explanations of grammar or advanced sentence structure. Additionally, within a year I hadn't practiced (I ended a 376 streak back in 2022), the beginning lessons seem to think that knowing ""a cool lawyer"" is more important to know than ""he"" or ""she"". I mostly use it for learning to write Kanji now."
"I'm unable to practice words that I've learned in the app. I just get the message ""an error has occurred"" when I try to. Samsung 23 Ultra. Beyond that, the app works well, but I want to reinforce what I have learned outside of the lessons! I've tried to contact the developers, but I have not had any replies. I will update my review when this issue is resolved. I am a super duolingo user."
"The app has improved in speed, and now has speed drills in every unit, so that I can focus my practice where I think I need more. I wish that I could bank the 15 minute double points windows, to use when I am free, the way that the app lets me bank the 30 minute double points window for completing the friends' quest."
"The community leaderboard is a big part of the gamification behind this app, which makes it fun to play. It's a nice app, but the leadership board is so glitchy that it takes the fun away for me. When you grind out a lot of points to progress, only for them not to show up and you get bumped down for another week, it's a bummer."
"The blocking animations after every single lesson are a waste of our time. Speech detection ain't what it used to be Often gets stuck and fails to detect the first few words again and again even when speaking the language perfectly. Seems to be some sort of glitch, results in lost hearts and less practice."
"it is such a great app. it really helped me to improve my full korean. I'm Indian but I know korean now, there are so many languages, you can choose your favourite one, or any language to know it for fun or for other purposes. You all can believe me that it is really a wonderful app. thank uh Duolingo for making me understand the korean. I was also thinking that it is not real, and I was not interested in it. but when I used it for once, I found that it is a very good app.Thankuh once again.💌💗"
"I like it but the part about ma'am being 2 separate words threw me off... I lost points and I'm pretty sure it isn't 2 words... Ma and 'am were 2 different selections for senorita... Also the pictures can be deceiving, the one with the cat holding a credit card is confusing because it's a cat not a human... made me think it was disturbing the person's study so I chose ""study"" instead of ""pay""... cats don't use credit cards so it wasn't clear enough what was going on in the photo."
"This app takes full advantage of gamification to urge you on in language learning. It covers reading, writing, listening, and speaking. It also helps you figure out vocabulary and grammar in a natural way. This is a great app for starting a new language. Definitely worth the reasonable cost for the upgrade if you are serious about learning."
"Progress reset, came back after a while and all my progress on japanese was reset and the new system of hearts is plain ****, the grammar hasn't improved a bit and i can understand adds but the constant interruption is extremely disruptive a small add could have been set at the very bottom of the screen generating revenue without interfering as much as it does now"
"The time trial levels (those where you can earn up to 3 stars) are intentionally near impossible to master. It's obviously a cash grab to spend the premium currency. I let 4 of my native speaking friends (Spanish) try the first 5 time trials. None of them could achieve 3 stars. And yes, they were very fast. The last tasks always ask you to write what you hear. Nobody can write that fast. You have to be very lucky to get more regular tasks, or you have to spend money to extend the time. Cashgrab"
"I like how Duolingo lets you learn languages in a fun and often engaging way, especially with the leaderboards giving a competition. Personally, I would put in a language comparison feature for people who are learning multiple languages with the app to compare words that mean the same thing in the Native Language, and the other languages learnt by the app. Kind of similar to the ipad and computer versions, but with more features and word specification. Other than that, I think it's great."
"it's an amazing application for learning languages. it's very interactive and fun with less Ads. I recommend it to everyone who is interested in learning any language offered by this amazing platform. I should I rated it 5 stars but I'm still learning french on this app. and I'll rate it 5 🌟 Once I completed my french course. merci beaucoup, Duolingo😘"
"Easy and gamified way to learn any language. Great community and several users. My only issue is it doesn't count how often you took a lesson per day, and only focuses on streaks. I, as well as some of my friends with busy lifestyles, would like to keep count of how many days I signed in for a lesson, and not focus on prioritizing my streak once i lose my streak, I suddenly lose interest in learning the language itself through duolingo"
"Great tool for introducing yourself to a language and getting familiar with the basic concepts. You aren't going to be fluent in a year, or conversational in a month, but it's a great way to get to the point in a language where you can start listening to and processing the language at speed, at which point you can basically google translate the rest of the way. I generally am against the kind of ""slot machine"" mechanics used here, but it is actually a great motivational tool in this case."
"It's good, but what makes this a stress is the lives you get when incorrect, I thought this was a learning app, not a testing app, I want to learn languages, not be tested every second with a second timer and a life counter, I wish there was a way of not dealing with that issue, I'm not a fast learner, my mind can only handle a certain amount of sentences before it gives up. Please just make a regular learning app."
"After using this app with Hebrew for almost a year, I dropped a star. They are very, very good with some things but not so good in others. For the Hebrew, they have ""practice your words"" launched, but it doesn't work at all on the Android app and is only semi-functional on the web (no audio). They are not good at responding to user feedback, either. After I have completed a year, I will probably drop my paid subscription and move to a different platform."
"This is a great app for learning because it definitely involves all the things that you need; recall, writing, movement, listening, speaking 🗣️ ... My one gripe is that the lessons teach you really odd stuff in the beginning! The beginning lessons of Portuguese/German involve animals... Can I get some directions? Or perhaps food? Basic lessons should be common things, no learning how to say ""owl or monkey!"""
"Learning japanese, and while it is fairly efficient, i have my critiques about it. 1. I am an extremely fast learner, and the fact you need to complete basically the same lesson around 9 times before moving on is annoying. I master the words in 2 lessons and cannot move on to the next lesson. 2. It disallows creativity in translations and most forced sentences sound unnatural. (""On weekends, i swim"" instead of ""i swim on weekends"")"
"If you haven't used Duolingo for several years, take another look, especially in Spanish. There is more in the app to teach you the language from beginner level then there used to be. I wish the app still allowed users to discuss the questions and answers, because I used to learn a lot from reading those discussions. Now I can't even see them."
"Greek... good at first?. gets very annoying quickly. Too many useless phrases! eg ""I give the glass to the elephants"". Teach me to order food, buy things, count to more than 1!, ask for directions and help. Stuff that is useful when visiting Greece!!! Allow me to abort rubbish modules? Many of the units don't build in any coherent way. Numbers are taught randomly. The speaker talks too fast and not clearly. Very disappointing!! And as an app, the maths for XP's is atrocious."
"Fine app for beginners, but not ideal for people with intermediate knowledge of a language who are seeking to improve. There is a ""pre test"", however, it does not properly assess your knowledge or place you accordingly. I've taken 2 years of Japanese and was hoping to learn new words, and it's instead teaching me the alphabet. There is no way to skip it. I found it does this with every language that has a foreign alphabet."
"This is an amazing app. I love learning new languages on it. It also let's you fix a mistake which helps the learning process. I wish there were more listening and Repeating. I am someone who can easily learn a word phrase or sentence in another language by listening and Repeating several times. I'm sure I'm not the only person that can learn this way. Overall, this is an app I use regularly! Thank you to the creators that made Duolingo 😊"
"I'm giving up on this app. I used to practice daily but I noticed tiny issues, such as not accepting when I misspelled a word and what not, essentially things that I really can't be upset at. With that being said once I began the French lessons the little bit that I did know was being taught incorrectly but was able to power through. I'm doing German now, when I get to one specific activity where it's ""Ich ____ ___"" I'm unable to do anything, and after trouble shooting, I'm finally over it."
"Could be better, too many words to learn at once and no real time to really understand the meaning of things and put it in correct context before moving on the next topic. Good recall of random words but not helpful for fluency. Would be good if it had a this is what you said and this is what it should say in the corrections so I can see where I have gone wrong, esp with same words that mean different things. Going over topics doesn't help if there's no explanation or context."
"such a great way to learn. Duo has written, spoken and audio lessons of a steady build up of words to increase you language skills with a thorough understanding of aural and written word as well as pronunciation. I'm picking it up quite quickly. I feel like I'm well on my way to being reasonably fluent."
"I have an auditory processing disorder so I have a hard time with the spoken portions, but thankfully I can slow them down! My only complaints are that I don't know how to access the tips and tricks so I keep making small mistakes and losing hearts over it, and the leagues are kind of pay to win as well. I never thought I'd see a pay to win learning app."
"This app is genuinely good. Encouraging, cute and the feature that you may run out of hearts actually makes you be more careful while doing the exercises. Recommend it 100% . Doesn't matter if your objective is fluency, you can still use it to improve your French. One of those apps which isn't actually cruel to its nom premium users. Just a few glitches here and there which will probably get fixed soon. Edit - it got even better. Gives you some free time of using the premium feature as a REWARD!"
"on Duolingo I learn Spanish, I started around September/October 2023 and now speak Spanish almost fluently it's the most effective way of learning and and the easiest you can buy streak freezes on a day u can't be bothered 😬🤫 or are busy 😂. Overall this app picks up on everything you are not quite strong on and strengths it. I 100% recommend it for and think it deserves the 5 stars ps: don't look up Duolingo on TikTok 😂😭"
"The app was good, but now its going downhill like most apps. It keeps telling me I am offline when I am not and when I do find a way to start a lesson, it works for some time and goes back to saying I'm offline. I even uninstalled and reinstalled it and still the same issue, even going as far as to write an email about the issue. I have a 125 days streak and it is hell to keep it up and I am almost about to drop out of the Diamond league because I can't practice at the right time. Please fix it"
I really like the format: shirt lessons which includes varied learning styles and the fun animations and reward system. This appdoesnt function the best as I have had to uninstall and reinstall 3 times. If it wasn't for that I would have given it 5 stars.
It is very good on the whole. There is a great variety of exercises in each unit. The odd English sentence had an incorrect structure or word usage. Some of the content was not functional enough for my needs. I would and have been recommending Duolingo to many others.
"I've been doing Duoling along with my high school Spanish class, and thanks to Duo, I am the best Spanish speaker in my whole grade, maybe even in the whole school! Duolingo has really helped me with my Spanish, especially the vocabulary learning that we all hate, and I would not be getting A's in Spanish class without it. In essence, I would highly recommend using Duolingo even if you only desire to learn a language casually, but especially if you're in a Spanish class of some sort. Thanks Duo"
"as far as I have it I say that yes, learning new languages the school way is more than ever boring,but this app makes it a lot of fun, because just like video games, you have quests to complete, treasures to open and the best part is that during all this it feeds you the veggies without showing them,that ways u learn in fun, and the leader board ofc, that is what keeps me committed. Good job Duolingo."
Still can't do any of the speech related excersises. It just switches off as soon as you open your mouth and says that doesn't sound right when you haven't even been able to speak in the first place. I do however like the way it teaches you a language only wish I could choose mother tounge rather than learning from a second language...
"Update: they charged my credit card a renewal but didn't credit the app. I have contacted their support email several times with absolutely no response. I sent a copy of the credit card payment again, crickets . The app was better in the beginning. Now it looks like it's written by 12-year-olds. Very woke, many many ads."
"I started back in november and found that, although not perfect, i was learning. The main issue why i stopped is because I was loosing lives over small mistakes or simply by showing me new words that ive never seen. After 5 lives you had to wait 4 hours to get 1 back, forcing you to either be very slow on your progress or quitting. But now, you can do small revisions and gain 1-2 lifes back watching an add. Great stuff, i love this implementation. Makes it much more rewarding"
"Because no grammatical information is given, and you have to figure it out, or guess, doing just 20 minutes is exhausting. After I finish this Duolingo course I'm going to have to do a real course to learn all of the things that I was forced to just guess here. To give you a context, I speak several languages already, have studied in University how to teach second languages, and have spent about 7 years of my life teaching second languages."
"This learning app is great but it has the hearts that make it waaaaay more annoying than it should be because every time I make a mistake I shouldnt have to do more lessons or wait 4 hours to get 1 more chance to do it. And they need to fix the fact that if you learn any language with foreign symbols like japanese, than you cant type them in the typing box, so I can only use the word part options instead of the typing, which I think would be more cool. Please fix these duolingo."
"Listen, I like duolingo. I do. But I'm literally uninstalling because of the creepy, off-putting, owl icon. I don't want to look at it anymore and I especially don't want to get baited into opening this app by an icon change I have no control over."
"Terrible! The app has become unusable now. It keeps rolling back to a previous state undoing all the lessons I've done. I've lost count of the number of times I've attained legendary status on the same lesson only to find myself back at square one. As it's not letting me progress any farther, I guess I'll have to continue my polyglot journey on some other platform. Should've known when they started removing useful stuff like discussion forums while introducing useless UI changes & nag screens."
"I enjoy the app, and lessons are a good mix of fun and challenging, but frustrated that I use the paid version while Android users don't seem to have access to Music/Math at this time. Also have issues with 30-min XP boosts from friend quests disappearing when I select them, rather than actually giving me a timed boost."
"Simply the best app to learn any languages completely for free. I use it to sharpen my English, Spanish and Russian while helping my friends learn some of the languages as well. I can't recommend this application enough for anyone interested in learning a second or even third language as well, and it's best to pair it with some other study material like a YouTube video or possibly even an online course."
"I've been using Duolingo for roughly a year now to learn German. It's a great app. It's courses can help beginners, advanced and anything in between! It has many languages to choose from. But, it can buffer and have a lot of lag. Overall, it is an amazing app for anyone to enjoy!"
"was going great for a while but after about 120 days in, my courses were altered and I was hit with a bunch of words I didn't actually learn. i don't see why y'all can't update the courses AND offer a means to catch up on new material in ""finished"" courses. put a huge rut in my momentum. also boo ai , will not be resubscribing. add: I like the words practice , except where it uses 80% of the same words from day to day. I have almost 600 words learned but every day is pilipala, gafr, rŵan etc🙄"
"Learning has never been this fun! I am learning Japanese language through Duolingo for past 15 days and it has been an awesome experience for me. I have not gotten bored or overwhelmed. However, at some places things can get repetitive but can be used for revision. I only urge the people at Duolingo to (ku da sai) add more Indian languages apart from ""Hindi"" which is already present. I wanted to learn ""Telugu"" my native language, but couldn't find one."
"Wonderful app to learn different languages, I enjoy the different ways of teaching and learning, reading in English, reading in an alternate language, matching in 2 languages and repeating sentences. I do believe it will benefit many ages as myself, husband and 8 year old all enjoy the app."
"Duolingo is on the whole a great app. I am deeply concerned with the recent change to monetize gems, and consequently to then charge money for higher XP rounds (Note: in premium, where I already pay a subscription). An app that is designed for kids has now become yet another in-app purchase monster. You should immediately fire the money-grubbing execs who though this was a good idea."
"For a gamified learning app, I've been disappointed to find inaccuracies in calculation of scores and ""daily quests"" completed. I submitted a bug notification and received a canned response saying not to expect my issue to be addressed directly and asking me to upload screenshots anyway. The lessons are fair for increasing comprehension, but I'm not planning to renew my subscription."
"I just started learning Japanese using Duolingo. Before I started, I already know a lil bit of its grammar and most of it characters and how to write then. I just noticed that the pronunciation of some characters are incorrect and the some english grammars are weird. This app must also accept other answers cuz I end up with a wrong answer even if my answer is the same from the correct answer but just in a different arrangement of words. Some pronunciation just really bothers as they're incorrec"
"It's still terrible & getting worse. Watch ads to get gems every hour, didn't work yesterday. Get points & 2xp for daily goals, nope. Pay 2,000 gems to freeze your league streak, pay & they don't restore your 61 weeks. The game aspect keeps one from advancing one's learning bc staying on top is the ultimate goal as opposed to just learning. They also don't respond to email."
"I keep trying to use Duolingo []. There's no explanation anywhere of course structure and no way of contacting Duolingo. I don't even know what sort of Arabic they claim to teach. I've posted before but never get an answer. Months later: so fed up with Duolingo I'm on brink of uninstalling. NO grammar explanations, not even a vocab list so it's often a case of guesswork to get exercises right. And today after a loooong session I ended up losing ALL the XP I had gained for no obvious reason.👎🙄"
"Duolingo has been an incredibly useful tool in my language learning journey. The variety of languages offered and the gamified learning approach make it enjoyable to practice regularly. The lessons are well-structured and gradually build on each other, helping me to grasp new concepts effectively. The community aspect adds a fun competitive edge, and the option to practice speaking and listening skills is a great addition."
"This is a great app. I picked up navajo to learn a tonal language but sadly they don't have any audio past unit 1. Can't really learn the tones if I don't have examples Edit: the lessons in unit 3 of Navajo will not accept alternative ways writing six ""hastą́ą́"" the program either moves the accents or just doesn't accept the word without accents, I cant continue this unit until fixed"
"I paid for a subscription, so I have high expectations for this application. So far, I've only had two issues. I was completing lessons but was not able to access the leaderboard. Next, while in a lesson, I was not allowed to type my answer and had to submit blank, which gave me an incorrect answer. I hit the flag icon to report. Hopefully, these issues do not become frequent."
"This is a great app, it helps you to learn new languages so easily and I'd especially recommend this app to students who need help with exams aswell as teaching them the expected level of the level you are at, it excellent you to be the best in your class. While using duolingo I got 50 out of 51 on my French test which included questions which I hadn't learnt in class but I had seen or learnt in Duolingo. That helped me a lot so please use this app as it's good for your language development"
it holds you artificially back so your learning process is extremely slow and tedious due to the vast amount of (unnecessary) repetitions you have to make to progress. taking shortcuts to a topic you want to learn is virtually impossible. overall a very unsatisfactory experience which seems to be more interested in keeping you in the loop as a (paying) customer than actually helping you to learn the language.
"I'm really confused, I am learning Chinese and all my lessons just completely changed. It says I have done 3 when I had actually done 5. And the ones it says I have finished are completely different content than when I actually did them. If you are changing the lessons I would appreciate a heads up, and accurate credit for the lessons I did. And new lessons for the ones I didn't do."
"I like this owl. The app makes it easy to learn and refresh on a language with bite-sized lessons. I enjoy the short stories, along with the ability to fix my mistakes and the chance to regain hearts. The challenge mode, where one matches words to the language's equivalent word, is quite fun."
"In the 5 days I've been trying to learn Spanish, VERY HARD FOR. SOMEONE LIKE ME, but duolingo makes it very easy to learn, they go step by step, word by word, mistake by mistake, it will definitely take a while to learn but duolingo makes it go by so fast because they structure their app so well and makes the lessons in a game type forearm, if u want to learn a new language duolingo is ur best option if ur wanting to learn on the go, in the comfort of ur home, THANK YOU DUOLINGO."
"I've been using Duolingo for just over a year with about 8 months of premium - It's been largely effective at helping me learn my target languages, however the perpetual lag that the Android version has from the iOS version, constant feature cuts, and consistent issues with speech recognition cause the app to fall short of ideal."
"I love it, it helped me learn Spanish it taught me so many things and it reviewed the mistakes I made and it's so amazing I just don't like that the hearts don't get refilled until hours gone past I wish it was like 10-15 minutes but thats fine I recommend you duolingo when you want to travel and learn new languages and words you never knew! Sincerely. Kathy"
"I learned both my native language (English) and my second language (German) by practice and use, not with a book or lessons. I had been slowly learning Spanish until I started with Duolingo. The repetition and easy of using a language, not just studying, has greatly accelerated learning. I am happy to practice to earn ""hearts"" to keep going as this provides repetition which makes me even more proficient. I like the ability to start and stop. As an educator for over 20 years, I love this."
"It's a really good app for me, even tho I'm 13, I really enjoy these characters tellinge if it's correct or not. And it also doesn't have any ads which makes me real happy. I learned a lot of languages, like: French, German, Danish and Russian! So I practice this game every single morning so I can learn a lot of new words! I rate this a 5 stars!"
"if you're interested in learning a language it's a definite grab. in just a few hours I've learned a huge amount of Spanish. yo habla Espanol 😌 the UI is slick the sounds are tuned and I love the personalities, especially the Gothic Spanish girl lol. there are high scores if you wanted to be competitive. you do both verbal and written assignments and you can pace yourself , me personally I'm going all out! really want to learn Spanish this year. It's definitely worth it. 💚"
"I have decided to learn Vietnamese as a supplemental skill for my job. Asian languages are extremely difficult to learn, especially for native english speakers. Thanks to Duolingo, I have learned enough so far to communicate on a basic level with several of our customers. The idea is that we will have better business opportunities if I can connect with certain customers in their own language."
"The app used to be amazing, but now it won't allow speech practice. Everytime I 'tap to speak' it doesn't allow and automatically marks the question wrong. I have reported this at least a dozen times, as well as uninstalled/reinstalled, checked permissions and updated all to no avail."
"GENERALLY PRETTY GOOD APP, BUT MAY NOT BE DEPENDABLE ON IT'S OWN: It's important [this may at least somewhat vary depending on what language(s) you're learning] to not just depend on duolingo to learn a language, because the way it teaches is at least somewhat random and may not teach all the grammar & nuances, but it is a pretty good app overall and updating relatively often and can help w/basics & vocabulary"
"Duolingo has certainly improved a lot in the 2 years I've used it. There's still room for improvement with using your phone's mic in speaking lessons and it would be nice for it to show you what words mean when you are practicing hiragana more, not just on the odd occasion."
"Duolingo has to be the best language learning app I've seen but I have one problem with it, I think they kinda rushed the Korean in unit 4, it was introduced to fast, making it hard for people to learn easily. It's not easy learning up to thirty words at the same time, I think that has to be fixed"
I'm not sure if I haven't made it far enough but music is a huge part of my life and it'd be really cool if as a community you guys added songs you listen to that we can practice our listening skills as learners with. or like a lesson using a song would make it easier for my adhd brain too. a rhythmic style of learning that makes me want to sing along in a language I don't feel confident in yet sounds really awesome. also I had to use chat GPT to explain the tenses of bebo bebe and bebes
"On the one hand, the application helped me significantly with learning hiragana and katana. on the other hand, due to addictive mechanics, I devoted more time to maintaining my position in the league, almost completely excluding learning something new. After I went to another country, I connected to another version of the application and it was simply overwhelmed with advertising"
The free version is more than adequate and the adverts are not excessive. Lessons are very simple and repetitive to ensure learning. The paid for version is much better as you don't lose lives for mistakes so can study for longer. I've been learning Spanish and German. Both are very good.
"Really iseful and helpful app, to learn languages! Nice GUI, friendly support, easy and understandable lessons. Although there's one con: sometimes if you have Duolingo on several devices but using them in a turn or on ocaasion, the logo of Duolingo,will turn into a somekind of ugly melteddown creature, which will be on your screen and you can't choose a logo.... 4/5."
Would not recommend getting Super Duolingo. When I signed up for Super I agreed to a monthly billing cycle that I could cancle at any time. I supposed since then the terms changed to only an annual subscription and I was charged $92 dollars at once for 12 months that I did not sign up for. Great app but wouldn't invest in it again.
Good for learning words and an introduction to a language but lack of explanations about grammar can be frustrating. Wish the repetition was more tailored to my progress. The gamey addictive nature creates a daily habit. Speaking & listening exercises are good for familiarity and pronunciation.
"Duolingo is a great concept and is incredibly engaging in how it gamifies learning a language. But it doesn't give you the tools to start speaking essential basics of the language right away. Rather, it seems like it took a Kindergartener's curriculum and converted it into a language course; teaching obscure animals names at the start instead of how to converse about someone's day, order food, or ask for directions."
"It is next to impossible to click the X to close out ads, so I end up in the Google Play Store way too many times per lesson when I do not use Super, which is costly. The language learning tactics seem to work, though!"
Duolingo makes it fun to learn a new language! And I like how it saves the words you've learned so far so you can look through them again and see their meanings. The reward system is very encouraging and the characters have so much personality!
"the best app for learning a new language!! and, free! what i would suggest: for the ""select what hear"" exercise, there is no translation when you only have single words. it would be nice to have those translated also (so, when selecting them, you hear the pronunciation, but it would be good to read a translation also). thanks and keep up the good work!"
I deleted it. I am one step away from uninstalling. The number of words you need to translate in a sentence should never change. You are actively tripping people with ADHD up by constantly moving the target. You also never account for simple typos where two letters change places getting marked wrong for things like that is counterproductive. I clearly understand and my only error was having fat fingers. People with ADHD experience rejection sensitive dysphoria and it will turn us off the app.
"I'd rate Duolingo 4.5 out of 5 stars. It's an effective and fun way to learn a new language with its interactive lessons, gamified approach, and diverse language options. However, some users may find it lacks in-depth explanations or advanced language skills. Overall, it's a great tool for beginners and casual learners."
"Quality has been getting worse and worse. I sometimes show the excercises im learning to someone who is fluent in the language I'm learning, and they tell me that many of the translations are wrong. Even I can tell now that some of the translations are just rubbish or nonsense that would never be used by native speakers. On top of that duo ignores every problem you flag. It's like they have switched over from real translators to labotomised ai bots. I will not review my sub or recommend to other"
"It s a great app if you want to learn a language. However, I find myself very anxious to make a mistake, as u know once you reach 0 hearts you either have to pay or you lose all the progress you have made. This is NOT the solution."
"During high school, I took 3 levels of Spanish class but never took them seriously. Now I decided I want to actually commit and finally learn. This is the best place to learn, and they really do a good job making it fun to learn a new language while making quick progress towards your goal. Deserves nothing less than five stars!"
Great since I started to use it. But if this reaches the dev team I'd recommend (on exercises where we have to put labels to form a phrase) to queue the audio for each word instead of just not finishing the current word.
"Used to be a wonderful learning device but since these recent updates the GUI has been terrible and the bugs even more terrible, unplayable. The only way I can keep my streak is by doing stories. Duolingo, please sort it out."
"Lately the 2x xp is not doubling the xp. You work to get a reward, you accomplish the requirements, then the app repeatedly just doesnt grant it. Why do the quests and work to place in a leaderboard when the app unreliably in it's award system anyway? Really disappointing."
"The app works great and I'm learning multiple languages. The app icon changes to a sad face of I haven't opened the app in a certain amount of time. -2 stars for attempting to guilt tripping me to use your app. I'm honestly thinking of uninstalling and learning from another source because I want to learn, not appease a Tamagotchi."
"I used to use the app all the time but since all these ads started to pop up after every single lesson, I started to use it less and less beacsue it isn't about learning how to improve your language as much anymore. And I really wish that Duolingo could stop forcing the super Duolingo down our throats all the time, it has gotten more about advertising than helping us in prove in language learning. PLEASE REMOVE THE UNNECESSARY THINGS!"
"It's fun, and addictive, for a free app you get a lot, and it's interactive also, im learning Spanish, and it's always switching things up, one lesson you speak, the next lesson you listen to a video, and translate, the next you spell it out, etc etc 👍"
"I love the new learning path, I know it's controversial, but I think it's more motivational to me. The only problem is that some of the daily quests are a little tedious, for example, 'read the next story on your path'. However, it is a great app for free! There are a variety of languages to learn and I feel like it has really helped me learn French and Spanish. I also love that you can do a quick lesson to save your streak, so even if you are short on time, you can still do something."
"it's a very good app for learning, but the alphabets are not here so it might be a little bit difficult to pronounce. here I am learning German and I thought the alphabets and pronounce is the same as normal English but when I looked in Google the pronouncetion was different. that's the only problem I can think of . either that this app very useful.. from India 🇮🇳"
"Duelingo is super fun in super educational . You should let your kids get it if they want to learn a second third or any any number of languages, and if they wanna learn multiple languages at once, they have the option to work on like 3 or more different languages. And it's helped me a lot on understanding Spanish. So I can talk to family."
"Love this app and I'm trusting that I'm learning well because I'm dreaming Spanish words now lol. Improvements: It would be great to practise all the words you learn and to have the translation of the sentences, even when you get them right. I've been using the app pretty much every day and it's a great new addiction! I'm addicted to the rewards and seeing my friends' progress making it almost a battle to be great! it's so infectious my housemate wants in on the fun too 😂"
"Hey duo, I used to love the app back then there were no hearts and I can learn as much as possible but I'm not requesting to remove hearts or something. I'm just asking to improve it. Like make hearts available for levels than on total or else a fuel strat like in asphalt games so that I can learn 5 lessons or something everyday. Also can you take care of the ad management? It's really annoying sometimes, like you can do something like Spotify does, watch an add and learn for 15 minutes?"
"This could be a great app, but the examples to use to learn a language are far detached from reality. Why should someone starting to learn a language knows what is an actor or a engineer??? A beginner needs to know things like right and left, or learn how to count; just usefull stuff. But Duolingo STARTS with words in you might never need even if you advanced in a language."
"I have loved the multi- pronged approach of DuoLingo including listening, speaking and writing, stories and exercises, and so much more. what I have found challenging is that a less formal way of speaking often found ""in the street"" is not acceptable in the exercises. Also, challenging is there seems to be no way to earn hearts that are taken when a mistake is made except to watch ads. Perhaps having hearts earned when a level of competence is demonstrated would be a way to continue learning."
"Designed to be monetised rather than being a useful tool to learn language, numerous useful features moved behind paywalls and the glitchiness of the app doesn't help learning when you lose the ability to study with each 5 mistakes. Now paying for it they still lock one of the practices (match madness) behind a paywall/ridiculous skill ceiling so it stays at 2 stars. As an app, it's decent. Terrible monetization. The lack of online mode is an insult, too."
"Duolingo is a great free language learning app. You can learn multiple languages at the same time and their strategies are very helpful. You practice listening, speaking and writing in those languages. Another fun aspect is that you can challenge your friends and work together to complete friend quests! You can add them, give them gifts and congratulate each other for their hard work learning. It is a marvelous app and you should give it a try! 👌🇫🇷🇩🇪🇦🇪🇪🇸🇰🇷"
I love this app. I do it at least twice per day. Huge fan. But lately it's super glitchy. It keeps freezing up. I hope it can get sorted out soon. Seriously considering something that rhymes with scrabble right now.
"A good course but, irritatingly it uses American English. I studied mathematics, not math and I actually go to the cinema (Italian word cinema) not a movie theatre. I have to come back to this and take off a star. This course was written by an American script writer. It's Police not Cops, autumn not fall. Secondly, some of the Italian words are not the same as would be everyday. I have an Italian course on Audible and there are significant variations."
"Hi developers! One star for forced ""Sad Duo"" app icon. I actually really enjoy the app, but hate having my home screen messed with. Return the option for a static app icon (such an easy fix!) and it's a 5-star app for me."
The app is useful and a fun way to learn a new language. I like how it teaches you the language from step one. The characters are fun to. However there are adds but not many. Overall a fun app.
"this helps alot for learning languages slowly, I just wish there was more to choose from. I d9nt understand why there's a meme of duolingo going to kill you,like yeah it's a joke but it doesn't make sense.. Overall Duolingo is a good learning app. just wish there's more languages to choose"
Usted to be good app... now plenty of exercises to repeat what your hear. Plenty to read ... but no really exercises to translate sentences. Why? I used to learn a lot with making mistakes while trying to translate sentences. Now it's been reduced a lot so I'm switching to different apps I'm afraid. I feel that I'm loosing what I learned through few last years 🤷‍♂️
"This is a good way to learn a language. however, I'm changing my review since the last update due to me being so close to a 100-day streak, and the next day, they wiped my streak clean, I spent hours upon hours on this and they just done me dirty, and took $8 from me and it still didn't give my streak back... Fix your app"
"it's working well although sometimes the speech mode is painful. After using this app for 3 months I have issues. There is little rotation in the speech lessons and words sections. I use it to review but get the same patterns all the time. I also have issues with the speach not accepting anything I say or any way pronounced . And, how do people get 9,000 points in 2 hours of new level opening? There need to be grammar rules to help understand."
"I bought super Duolingo and used it to learn Hindi. Really good app to learn. But need more sentences, vocabulary and grammar for Hindi. Not sure how it is for other languages. Please add more Hindi lessons for various scenarios with more sentences, words and grammar"
"Absolutely amazing. I cannot believe that this app has a YouTube channel. There was a bug that I found that even with animations turned on, the animations are stuck but still intractable. Please fix this bug so I can still be satisfied of how smooth your animation is. Thank you, Duolingo."
"This is best for continuing language practice when you've already studied a language. There isn't much structure or explanation behind grammatical rules or vocab. It's more of a pseudo immersion with some things but there's often little to no context with new vocab. Other issue is there's almost no wiggle room with sentence translation. It has to be the exact, translated wording that is programmed, or it's wrong. e.g. ""I also did this""/""I did this also""-only one of these would be correct."
"I was charged for one year with the usual ""you at some point accepted our sketchy terms so we'll take your money bye"". Tried to contact them through many different channels. Edit: Got refunded after mailing really difficult to find support email address. Ads are not intrusive but they are on very idiotic topics for being hosted on a learning app.."
"Very user friendly, I can't think of a better way of learning a language than this app. Recent the app as a bug, there is some irritating sound in the background as you do your lessons. It's too bad to point I feel like deleting the app. It happens once in a while but it's too annoying. I thought at first that it was phone, but then my sister told me it used to happen to her. , so please fix it"
