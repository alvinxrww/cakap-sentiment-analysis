"Duolingo was a great learning app but parts I hate. I learn 3 languages. French, mandarin, and Spanish. Sadly, sometimes, updates like adventure or the radio is something I want to try! I have legendary for literally the entire section two in french, so I COULDN'T DO IT. Sometimes updates changes your learning level but when I head into Chinese, I don't know a thing. When it changed I had no idea what was anything so I had to retry my entire progress. Please improve this. Would'be given 5 stars."
"I checked the alphabet tab and suddenly I found out that it has words for each of kanji letter (I am learning Japanese and Mandarin) and their meanings too. Maybe finally this app has added words that I've learned from the lessons. This is really important for me to review the words I learned. Also, there's too much vibration on each animation though."
"I would've gave this learning app 5 stars review if it not making me keep repeating courses that I've done before everytime there was a big update. As a learning app, this app is wonderful, the courses are gradually level up in the nice pace. But everytime there is a big update of the courses, my completed ""legendary"" level of the courses are gone, I've to re-do almost everything again, and it happened 3times already, it's frustrating. And if it happen again, then I would've quit this app."

"Been using this app for more than 30 days, i was really enjoy it, this app helps me to improve my chinese. However since they changed the sequence of hanzi, it has become harder to learn and practice lessons. The words are no longer linked, makes it difficult to focus on learning new words and sentences at one time. Hopefully the team listen and aware about this impact and restore the structure to prev version :)"
"Great UI, but very slow paced learning. This is a bad alternative to learning any languages, compared with 1. Books 2. Video lessons 3. Live courses 4. Flashcards The selection of words from their ""keyboard"" honestly makes it look more like a jigsaw puzzle than what could've been a great source to train spelling abilities (such as Japanese, Chinese, and Korean characters). I do understand that a lot of sentences can be expressed in many different ways, though, so this isn't quite a major issue."
"the practice is good, you can skip part of it if you think you're good enough.. i cant complain much about anything really.. however, if you learnt lot of vocab in japanese, use other app. This app has a slow pace, in kanji departement, you can learn it but it was slow, what would be great is if it would have some test about all kanji that you have unlocked. If you hear me dev. Team please implement this thanks"
"So far so good, on a free plan but will consider a subscription Edit, just had a notification to upgrade, actually the price is OK, but there is no option to pay monthly, all in one go 12 months up front, the problem with that is somewhere like Indonesia that is a lot of money up front that very few can afford, making the payment monthly is much fairer and would I believe result in more people signing up."
"With every update, it seems like Duolingo is upping the ante in trying to force a switch to paid version. When you go back to try to complete legendary status on an old lesson, the questions are very odd and obscure. Also, there are nearly all ""fill in the blank boxes"" without any supplied words or options. It's getting very challenging to even get to the half-way point without running out of hearts. I didn't have this problem before recent changes."
"Easy to use and understand. The UI is great. I enjoy the variety of methods employed to get words and phrases over. My only quibble is that,despite turning off notificatiins,I keel getting notifications about the league or whatever it is,that I have ZERO interest in. I'm just trying to expand my brain. I don't want some childish competition thrown into the mix. Especially one that seems able to overrule my settings preferences!"
"Overall excellent user experience. The repetition is good to remember and learn efficiently, there is no better way to learn than by practicing the language, and Duolingo understood that. However, it spends way too much time on the same thing in my opinion, it is too stagnant and I would like to go faster through the subjects. It would be great if the course adapted to my learning abilities. Aside from that, at least for conjugation, it would be great to have sheets that go over everything."
"Decent. I do Japanese and Spanish, and it's equally fine for both. Easy to practice listening and speaking, and for Japanese they have a place to practice just the writing. However, the app constantly changes your place in lessons, making it wildly difficult to know where you are and feel any sense of satisfaction with your progress. Competitiveness is now a non-negotiable component, and the app is now harder to navigate and it's significantly harder to find things. 3 stars."
"Often laggy, and filled with bugs. Can't count experience points correctly or straight up doesn't, then tells me that my streak has been frozen but it ends up restarting it. And when I try to finish a level, sometimes it doesn't take the whole exercise in consideration because I closed the ads as soon as I could. This has been a day to day struggle for the past week and I know it sounds cheesy, but I have friends who experienced the same. But when it does cooperate I guess it's kind of fine. ‚úåüíÄ"
"Early user of the app. So far what it does is great! my only issue is I am not really into the ""flare"" aspect of it. An ability to turn off some of that while keeping the learning\test part would be well received. I don't care about streaks and gems and ""way to go's"". I tend to like subtle/simple/clean. There are many 'loading screens' and prompts. I am using the free version, so maybe some of that goes away if you pay ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. However I am not seeing any option screens to allow customization."
"it's very engaging and emerrsive. it keeps you hooked. it's fun to keep at it and earn your spot on top of the leaderboards. take your time and don't make mistakes, and the free version is fine. if you find the courses getting challenging, getting super duo lingo paid for the unlimited hearts/ unlimited mistakes is worth it if you plan on sticking with it. i recommend waiting until you're offered the trail. if you don't use duo lingo much during your trail, don't upgrade."
"it's a great learning app. You should take a look at their YouTube channel, they're very funny. Back to the topic. the app is amazing. I love that you can learn multiple languages easily. You can postpone the speaking and listening exercises for later, instead of having to leave and have all of your progress reset. anyway, have a nice day or night! Edit: I don't like the new app Icon. Can you change it back to the old one? The melted-looking face is scaring m"
"Great app for learning. I think the app does well to progress you, but it's also up to you to put in the work to actually learn, e.g. saying every sentence (or at least most of them) even if it doesn't require it, not hinting every word of you forget it, actually taking notes on hard phrases or at least screenshots and reviewing them later. Learning is hard and needs to be active, not passive, in order to truly comprehend the concept and phrases presented."
"This app used to be great, but in recent months I have experienced numerous glitches. Daily challenges aren't recorded, points lag, and worst of all the practice sessions are almost always pronunciation or listening, which are difficult to do sometimes when in public. Clicking on ""can't listen now"" or ""can't speak now"" has no effect on the practice session. I have recorded these issues as feedback at least 3 times in the past few weeks, but nothing has changed."
It is very clever and very effective. Certainly keeps you motivated to keep using it and I got to speak Italian fast. Two downsides. Being AI driven it doesn't always make sense. Some translations it provides are literal and make no sense or it marks as a wrong answer if you put words not in the exact same order in the English language. The other very annoying downside is it is impossible to compete in the last two leaderboards against the paid accounts. I gave up on the leaderboards!
"The learning lessons are great, and I am learning. The subscription is beneficial. However, it was not made clear that it would br charged in one yearly subscription, instead of the $10 a month it states (for family plan). This was a bit deceptive, especially since they did not give the 2 day warning it says it will give before charging your account."
"A good way to learn the basics or to refresh memory of a language, especially vocabulary. while repetition is useful, sometimes it's too repetitive with limited opportunity to test out of easy stuff. I have just spent weeks learning more about 'lucha libre' (Mexican wrestling) than I ever wanted or would ever need. I am British and I am learning more about American English as well as learning (American) Spanish. Sometimes the English is really strange and I am not sure if it's a faulty translat"
"Thank you for this great app! I just wanted to tell you that, it would be great if you could expand the topics and words on the sections for Personalised practises. After some levels that you have in Practising sections, a lot of words and sentences are repeating and it is just making to learn only one particular part of the language. it would be great if you take a look on it ( I am talking about the section where app consists of only from Personalized practices). Have a good one!"
"The app itself is an amazing app such as to being a ""free"" learning app. But is it really so free because ever since they added all the ""super Duolingo"" stuff,it has been so annoying I'm getting ads all the time I'm restricted to features that should be available to the public. Another thing I'm mad about is ,the hearts. You should at least have maximum of 10 hearts. It gets so annoying whenever you lose all your hearts and have to get them back. So annoying but can be a really good app."
"The path layout is still inferior to the old tree layout, and it seems duolingo is hellbent on sticking to the new format. Beyond that, the app frequently ""updates"" in a way that conveniently forces you to lose legendary status on levels you had previously completed. This, of course, means you have to redo them and that costs money (if you're not paying for Super Duolingo). It seems the focus has shifted from making a superior product to simply making more profits."
"I have used Duolingo on and off for a decade. It does gamification very well, but it is so completely focused on translation, and the quality between courses varies greatly, especially if you aren't learning the most common languages. They push use on mobile devices, but the lessons, especially grammar are missing there. So very much potential, but they never fully realize it."
"Quit fun, though sometimes frustrating. The language course I'm doing keeps being ""tweaked"" for some reason and that puts you in a different place than you were before, meaning sometimes you end up learning stuff you learned a while back, or sometimes you end up ahead and missing necessary steps. That aside it's definitely helping me learn a language, and duo's daily reminders are great, I'd definitely forget otherwise!"
"Awful. I've updated the app to the latest version hoping the constant bug of audio missing in the English - Swedish course have finally been dealt with, but no. I keep reporting the problem with the audio for about two weeks now and all I get is ""Thanks! your feedback has been recorded"". I cannot complete some exercises because of this annoying problem."
"I used to love this app, but in recent months it has become riddled with errors, there is no feedback, the discussion boards are gone so there is no one to explain the grammar of a certain phrase. I report several mistakes in exercises every week, but they are never corrected. I have been to France several times and took years of French all through college and grad school. I have a six year streak and I use Duo to keep my language skills from getting rusty. Trust me: this app has major problems."
"very helpful. nice app. but I've noticed that in korean lessons, we're taught in a wrong way to write some letters. I realized because I'm following a youtube course simultaneously. And sometimes the app freezes and I'm unable to open it, and I lose my streak. I hope you would correct them. Otherwise this is one of the best apps I've ever had."
I like the convenience of this app and that I can do short lessons anytime. I have seen a lot of progress in how much I've learned in spanish and am amazed at how I can communicate in spanish speaking countries. You take out of it what you put into it. I don't enjoy the constant change of how you progress through the app and the levels. In the past few years they have changed the format of the app multiple times. I also don't like that now you only can get 5 wrong where before was unlimited.
"Although this app is the best on the free market, grammar explanations are only available on the website and not in-app. This creates confusion when trying to learn a new language and is unreliable long term. If they were to teach the why and how of grammar in the languages, it would be much better as a language learning app. Overall, the ads are not interupptive, and the lessons are alright. Have and would recommend to friends and family."
"overall, I enjoy it. i wish there was more one on one conversation to test skills. like chat bots. I would like to see different courses dependent on native language. Going from english to chinese is a whole new language system including pinyin, hanzi, and overall just a new way of reading. I find myself having to pace a lot, and I feel like I can not progress because I do not know the concepts enough to move on even after it says I have ""mastered"" it. Does not help my whole course changed."
"I miss the flashcards partner app. I appreciate the vocabulary section, but I wish you could study them in flashcards form again, not just in mini quizzes. I would also appreciate a greater sentence variety. I've seen some of the sentences so many times I don't have to translate I just know the word order, which isn't so helpful. This is a good app for learning different alphabets and characters though, as well as practicing sentence structure (that you might have studied in a textbook before)"
"Lately the app lags between sections using up your minutes. I have to re-open it so often to continue. Also the sound stops every once in a while which is frustrating. My husband has the same issues. Not sure if they did any updates as these weren't issues before. Edit: The free option is VERY limited, it's overly repetitive and the practice part doesn't review past difficulties just repeats the same phrases and now you get less points to practice. Not impressed."
"It was good for starting out, but it grew less useful with updates. At least for Japanese, all the nouns are always paired with the same adjective(s) ie. Black pants, red car, ble house, 2 birds, 3 cats. It made for a lack of variety, which hindered learning. Also, since the last update, Duo stopped defining new words for me when they were introduced. Duo is putting more effort into animation than into actual learning. The stories are a smart idea, but lack difficulty."
"App works consistently well, it's well-organized, and has lots of methods of keeping you engaged and having fun while learning. I'm about 5 months into learning Spanish so far, and it's basically a review of what I learned in high school, but that alone is great. I still have a very basic understanding, but I'm able to communicate a lot more in everyday scenarios. Really I'm doing this review to humbly ask that they change the logo back to normal. Depressed Duo is bumming me out."
"I have been using the app for over two years but will be canceling my subscription before it renews again. The app was good until a few months ago. Frequently, when I am granted a powerup, the XP isn't doubled as it should. Sometimes, it only doubles every other exercise. I reported this, but there is obviously no customer service. I really liked the forum because it helped me understand my mistakes. It would be nice if you could pull up the guidebook during an exercise."
"This used to be a 5 star review. But now they randomly moved all the chinese lessons around. Making my progress basically useless because I can't review previous lessons, SINCE THEY DON'T EXIST ANYMORE. This change makes it so I have to start over. But because the lessons still show that I have ""completed"" them, even though they changed. There's no sense of actual improvement. And I can't even keep track of where I was. I am so beyond disappointed and frustrated."
"I've been using Duolingo for several years. It's an amazing app and it's improving constantly. Great job! However, I miss the 'comments' feature in every exercise - the discussion there was really helpful sometimes. It helped me understand some things that were not explained in duo's tips. I would really appreciate it if you bring it back :("
"I feel used car salesman vibes about missing streaks, so I'm trying to turn most of the notifications off. I recommended this for anyone who has similar feelings. I know that research suggests that repeated daily learning intervals is the best way to learn, but I don't learn because of research, I learn because your in-app content, art, and variety is truly excellent. Please stop changing Duo's face. His uber-defeated/depressed look feels manipulative, not inviting. Happy Duo = more $$$ IMO ü§ë."
"This is a great app!! I am a beginner learner and am enjoying this app. The interactions are great, it's not time sensitive and it helps you to set goals. It also provides you the opportunity of going back and correcting the exercise you got wrong which I love!! I love the interactions and there are motivators along the way. The daily goals are awesome. It also gives you a chance to revise what you learned the day before, before going into new lessons. Thumbs up to the creator of this idea"
"For a free app, this is fantastic. Love the gamified experience and the fact that Duolingo offers such a variety of languages. Honestly, I'm hooked. Combined with a variety of other materials to work on other skills, I think it's a effective tool for language-learning due to its addictive nature. I'm a high school foreign language teacher and recommend it to my students as well for extra vocabulary practice. :)"
"Can't fault it, with a very useable and generous free route, and an obviously enhanced paid route at a very reasonable price, it is properly impressive. I can't speak to advanced levels, but beginner and rusty returner experience is excellent. You can plainly see the quality linguistic and pedagogical maturity, together with great application in software/web user interface. My only concern is that it seems to be sharing data with Google and Unity; possibly innocuously but I don't know."
"I love the app, the only downfall is there are a lot of ads, and I mean A LOT of ads, like, I can't go one unit without an ad popping up outta no where, but, still a great way to learn a new language. Plus, a lot of people think that Duolingo is just Spanish, but you can do French, Italian, Japanese, heck, I'm learning Spanish and Irish, so, you can learn so many different languages on this app. 9.5/10 recommended."
"While I understand why they want to push users to upgrade to Super status, and have put up with the 30sec ad that runs after most lessons, the new changes to this screen are pathetic. They removed the ""no thanks"" option and the only way to bypass the screen is clicking the small, unresponsive X in the top corner... Usually 5-6 times before it closes. The only button presented to users is to continue with a costly recurring billing option."
"this app is SOO good. I'm learning/practicing Russian, and so far I know simple sentences. there's a lot of stages with different topics that you would use, such as, greeting, foods, and drinks,jobs, etc. for example- (Is mark a coach?) it's been going really well and I'm honestly starting to understand Russian. there's so many languages to choose from, different levels, and even has a leader board. üíØ definitely recommend it if you're looking to learn a new language! best part? It's free!!"
"Even with premium, there are still prompts to buy gems, and unreasonably high prices for freezes and timer boosts, the latter specifically. The rapid review is ridiculously difficult, taking roughly 10 tries to finish a single star. Frequent UI changes. Chinese only goes to a1 level and is a little obtuse. Power up chests are inverted(morning one opening at night and vice versa), don't Open for the whole time period, or at all. Got rid of the conversations feature. Doesn't fix chronic bugs."
"It's OK. But there are better apps out there. This app can become annoying, and demotivating after a while. I was using it to brush up on a language I hadn't spoke for 15 years, I found the sentences they gave to be unnatural. Expected responses are too ridged. Often there are 2 or 3 right ways to respond, you have to guess what they are expecting. Sometimes their English is simply wrong or too americanised The gamification is pointless, eventually demotivating. You can do better."
"This app is useful for basic vocabulary & pronunciation. I've used it mostly for French, but also Danish, & Spanish. I don't feel like I am making much progress or am learning the reasons why the language is what it is, which is frustrating. I've been using it for 1.5 years. There used to be a section with long reading and listening, when I first started. Now it's short lessons only. I miss the longer format lessons. I miss using a book and understanding basic rules and tenses."
"first let me say that I think everyone's learning style is different. I personally have learned a lot from duo and really enjoy using the app. they do use friendly competition as a form of motivation but I've learned that it is not required for you to engage in competition for you to use the app. you can totally just focus on the lesson aspect and ignore those parts. I also really enjoy the animation and characters in the app, it makes it fun!"
"The gamification of learning makes it easier to stick to, but it's very foundational. For the paid version I would have hoped for some more comprehensive learning material. It also teases you with fun little learning tidbits on loading screens but it loads too fast to be able to read them üòÇ You'll know the language on paper but need to find additional resources for learning to converse fluently."
"Depending on which language you're practicing, sometimes the annunciation of some words are difficult to discern. I'm learning Korean and French. In Korean, the AI voice makes it difficult to know the difference between vowles and consonants and you get it ""wrong"" because it's not clear. In French, when you speak into the mic, you can say the phrase and it won't pick up on certain annunciations and you get it ""wrong"". Super frustrating and is the main reason I will not pay for a subscription."
"Basically app version of my 90s high school Spanish textbook. Nothing groundbreaking. The voices are absurd and don't sound like ANY Spanish speaking person I've ever met. Visuals in the app are also problematic. Points don't always accurately accrue, and common Spanish phrases from different parts of the world keep getting dinged as incorrect. Even if you report it, the app does not correct your total. Nor is there any acknowledgement from Duolingo about the errors reported. Fine for free."
Simply the best language learning app available. I've tried many other options both paid and free but Duolingo beats them out easily. They are great about continuing to improve as well when complaints are voiced. A few examples. There are now chapter summaries before each unit giving context outside memorization. They've got reading lessons outside of the standard quizzes encouraging real understanding of what is read. I could go on but I'm out of space!
"Really dislike the negative notifications. Now the app icon has changed to a grumpy face. This is really unhelpful for someone that has grown up in a negative environment. Positive encouragement is much more appreciated. Also, I have hearing loss. I wish I could turn off the speaking part in settings. There's no way for me to hear the words properly so that I can repeat them perfectly."
"Love learning German and Greek through this! The only thing stopping it from getting 5 stars is the lack of explanation in actual lessons. I wish a little thing could pop up from the side that could clarify certain rules with, for example: Das, der and die. I know it has it but I wish it was more integrated into lessons. Overall solid app for any language learners! Edit: still loving this app, however the ending fire animation when you see your streak is going is terrible now."
I like the app very much and I have bought the plus subscription. But the issue which I am facing and it's very consistent is when the double XP time starts the aps loading times increases. Its really annoying because the double time is running and the quest is still loading. This happens most of the time when it's double XP activated. Developer team please look into it's very annoying and discouraging. Due to this I am giving 3 star. If improved then I will re rate the application.
"I started off having a free trial for duolingo that was supposed to notify me before I'd be charged, it didn't so I ended up paying over $100 for a year of super duolingo. I was unable to get a refund so I'm trying to make the most of the app but it frustrates me when the apps microphone just doesn't pick up anything I'm saying. I checked that it's not my phones microphone and I have excellent WiFi strength, I lose points because the app doesn't hear me."
"Great app, its making it super easy to learn Spanish. However, the app fails on my phone constantly, when I go to choose words for the answers, it won't choose any of the words. Have updated the app many times, and it always glitches again. Also, it doesn't do the speaking feature at all. Would give 5 stars if not for these factors"
"You app is marvelous, I even have a super duolingo subscription, BUT you have a really annoying design flaw on android, the ""can't listen now"" or ""can't speak now"" button is placed rather inconvenient, you must be getting this a lot. I keep hitting it by mistake which is rather annoying and really impractical during exercises with time limit. I would suggest to move the button somwhere to the upper part of the screen, also maybe add an option to turn ON listen/speak inside an exercise."
"I've used Duolingo of and on now for over 10 years the lessons are fun and interactive , and I can honestly say they have gotten better over time . Update I've had the app for a while.and I've noticed some glitches , little annoyances like telling me a sentence is wrong when I have the exact sentence / word / spelling so I'll be penalized and then move on but its annoying , and there are Soo many adds in the free version . Thinking I might need to shop around"
"This app has been improved a lot in the past 10 years. The animation and interface now is appealing. I just wanna recommend that in the word arrangement exercises, they should allowed users to move words around within the sentences instead of cancel and move them down and rearrange every words when users make one mistake. It would save so much time."
"Owner doesn't support product. This app was designed before dark mode became prevalent but they still use dark colors regardless of what visual mode you are using making much of the tutorials unreadable. The dark red color is the worst but the dark green isn't much better. Most pages go by so fast that it is impossible to review the information on the page so even if you get the answer right, you don't know what it is."
"At 1st the app was great, I was enjoying learning a new language, then the free version became more competitive. you got 5 lives, after 5 mistakes you couldn't do anything until the next day, unless you won extra lives. I still want to learn so I now use the app as a paid subscriber to get the unlimited lives. There's always goals to reach, challenges to beat, different leagues to get promoted to, or demoted from if you choose to be competitive, I don't as that takes the fun out of it for me."
"Duolingo is good. But the only thing it needs to improve on REALLY, REALLY badly is adding *grammar notes* throughout the lessons so that we can read to understand the change in feminine and masculine nouns and accents. Because then it would prevent people from searching for days on which term to use (because let's be honest, some of these aren't easy to find), so, then, spend more time in Duolingo understanding it."
"A solid app for an intro to language and becoming familiar with grammar and characters. The competitive aspects can inhibit my language retention and make effort feel hollow, but overall I find it worth it. I do have the Super Duolingo, and recommend it if your focus or momentum is interrupted by ads. Whilst not terribly intrusive, knowing that an ad waits for me at the end of a lesson made me slightly avoidant toward working on lessons."
"Excellent app! Well put together and easy to use Other than small issues, I've got no problems with the app, (e.g. monthly challenges, sometimes it miscalculates how many I've completed, + it does use American English, which could be confusing, but it doesn't impact the learning too much) I use it to compliment school lessons, and it broadens vocabulary, strengthens grammar, etc. I don't know whether you could become fluent solely through the use of Duolingo, but I definitely recommend this app!"
"This is by far the worst language app around. Accents on recordings are miss matched, and it is NOT ""ADA COMPLIANT"". There are no Instructions on how to use this app. Even the free version is not worth your time, I've wasted 94 days of my life. If you believe your answer should be accepted, no one looks at it, or gets back to you as to why. I'm going up against people who have up to 3 yrs experience in the language I'm trying to learn. Do better duolingo!"
"Absolutely superb app - especially if you pay for it (I hate ads, and a quick blast of the free tier early on convinced me to pay immediately...). At times it can be unreliable when you do the speech challenges, but other than that my only gripe is that it BADLY needs an English choice that is not American - the rest of us English speakers around the world frequently need to translate answers twice ;) (Can see a lot of the other reviews say the same thing, hehe)"
"It's really only good for a first taste of a new language, maybe for about a year, to get a few phrases and words down. Many languages don't have any grammar explanations AT ALL. In the practice tab the word review always reviews the same words, has been a bug for months. I can do that better myself just using a flashcard app and a grammar book. Though the streak is very motivating for me personally, the leagues not so much."
"Have been an avid user for about two years. Spanish 19+ months and Hindi 8+ months. I wish Bengali were an option too, there's a lot of languages in India, untapped potential growth for the app. I recommend Duolingo to many. Fun, interactive, the repetition and silly stories are great. Being able to team up with your friends for goals too. After the first year I signed up for the Super Family plan, really great for kids or others who would otherwise get discouraged easily. Great app."
"I think there is a bug in this app that doesn't allow me to move forward to the next lesson unless I closed the app and start it again. I checked that I updated to the latest version. But it is very annoying that this happens now and it happened once in the past. This time it doesn't seem to go away. Also, another problem I have is double XP doesn't work. Every time I complete the third task or complete the circle of lessons, it tells me that I get double XP, but I actually often don't get them"
"As a native italian speaker I have noticed that there are a lot of mistakes. The last few months there have been a lot of grammar mistakes as well. Were last year Duolingo with comment on your suggestion, now they don't and leave the mistakes in it. Sentences don't make sense, the app has gotten terribly bad in the last few months. I cannot speak for other languages but if they are like Italian then you are not learning the language properly. I am a paying customer for years but will not renew."
"Duolingo is a hit or Miss App. I used it for school, but it was a meh. This time, I use it for a language I'm learning for fun, and it already has me learning a lot of words in just a week. Duolingo has all sorts of language choices and has even updated since I last used it. It has writing/typing, speaking (new since I last used it), forming sentences, and other sorts of forms of learning. Although, duolingo is definitely not for everyone. Some like, and others don't think it works for them."
"Pros: 1. it is free (though the 5 hearts are quite limiting), 2. the gamification is fun. Cons: The setup and the lesson order does not make any sense. Here I am in the section 3, unit 2 of Russian course titled ""get around town, describe cities"" and more than half of the questions was about fitting clothes, and birds which are many or few depending on the season... in the meantime there are at least 3 different words for ""near"" and you get zero help as to when and why use one or the other."
A great way to learn a new language with fun incentives to keep you going when you don't always feel like it. I like the way it reviews past lessons to keep your memory fresh. I find I still need to practice talking to someone to practice the language. I'm very happy with this app and program and highly recommend it. Much better than repeating words and sentences from CDs which never worked for me.
"Genuinely helpful for my learning. It's been a lot of fun learning Chinese through this app! It's not as fun if you already are a decent level at a language though. For me, Japanese has been frustrating because the app expects its particular translations, rather than ones that might omit the subject as you would in natural Japanese. Still, Chinese is fun on Duolingo just learning from scratch!!"
"It's pretty great - as long as you're only interested in their ""top 8"" languages. The others are basically left in the scrap heap, with no new developments (generally fine) but more importantly no on going quality control, with some sentences being unnatural (for general sentences, not ""my horse walks on strawberries""), and others being completely wrong. I still hold out hope that the ""lesser"" languages will eventually get the spiffed-up treatment that the Top 8 get."
Interface works. I can see it being a good educational tool....but holy ads batman. The amount/length of ads in the free version make me not want to pay for it. The number of passive aggressive reminders to use it is also annoying. I get a nudge/reminder but the language used is borderline aggressive to get you to open an app that keeps yelling at you to pay for the full version. No thanks.
"Audio is far too often indiscernible between similar sounds („Öó vs „Öú), and far too much of the written language is left unexplained before you're expected to know everything about it at unit 2. Too much focus on romanizing. Learning full words is left to brute force memorizing through multiple choice questions. The app has hung on startup twice. The freemium model (even with super) promotes practices that defeat the app's purpose as a learning tool."
"This rating is specifically for the Irish course. It is horribly designed, requiring strict memorization of words with sometimes only a small difference. The memorization is needed because the hints are nonexistent for anything requiring even the slightest context, especially pronouns. The audios are also wildly inconsistent in both pronunciation and quality, sometimes being completely inaudible or unintelligible. I am leaving the course purely because it is nearly unusable as it is."
"It used to be great, but now its just horrible. Full of unnecessary prompts and notifications, useless interruptions about things other than learning a language, ads after you finish a lesson, bloated with useless features, I wish it was like what the browswer version used to be 10 years ago. No explanations, forums, tables, and nobody to ask questions about a lesson in the community anymore. You just click on the words in order 90% of the time. Also I lost all the badges from 10 years ago"
"Duolingo is flawless, I've been on it for 20 days now and no glitches, bugs or problems, I love the reminders and it's really neat to learn Spanish. I plan on sticking with this app for a long time. Superlingo subscription is totally worth it. Highly recommend, especially if you want to replace doom scrolling with something productive. 5 stars across the board!!"
"It's not the be-all-end-all of language learning but it does a great job and is very intuitive! I would give 5 stars but for some reason creating an avatar permanently deletes your old photo-based profile picture. I had to find an old APK on the internet to install on my phone so that the functionality is restored to upload a photo profile picture. I don't like the whole forcing people to use avatars decision... Glad I was at least able to solve it. I was like ""oh no what have I done"" üòÆ‚Äçüí®"
"I like the lessons and all the variety I really HATE the competition part and the streak part. when I signed up I thought I said no to the desire to be in ""competition"" i just want to use this fun app to learn new languages. I hate that after every lesson there is a ""choose a streak"" reminder. I just exit the app and that's usually the end my lessons for the day. I just want to be able to opt out of the contest leagues and streaks."
"Used to be a great app. Now there are WAY too many ads to be productive. And frankly it's not a robust enough language learning program to be worth the monthly subscription fee to get rid of the ads. There are literally ads every 1-2 minutes-- every single time you complete the extremely short modules. That's too much for me, so au revoir Duo!"
"Good learning app, but you can't cancel your duolingo super subscription easily. When trying to pay for the super monthly, it says an amount for a week, & you think: that's alright, let me subscribe. & it tries to take ¬£60. it says monthly, but you can only pay yearly. you can barely cancel your 2 weeks free, & then it charges you for a year, whether you want it or not. but the base game is alright, but still kind of hard to learn when you can make 5 mistakes, while learining, you make mistakes."
"A good method of practicing foreign languages in which you already have SOME knowledge. It might be hard to pick up a new language from scratch with this app, because it doesn't always teach the rules of grammar very efficiently. But if you already know the basics and want to be drilled on a bunch of practice sentences, or improve your pronunciation, this app is super handy and easy to learn."
I like the way it helps people learn. not a lot of apps are used to benefit the world but dulingo is. it's making the world more communicative. one word at a time.üòΩ I also like the way that duolingos reminders are different characters in the game reminding you to keep going. saying things like duo misses you!! and encouraging words when we need them most. it's gentle it's pure. duolingo is amazing and should honestly be appreciated more. beneficial and good app. your efforts are appreciated.
"The app is good, but you can not expect anything good since it's free. The main problem I have with learning here is that plural and singular are not explained, so most of the time, I lose a heart. The app has fixed sentences that give no opportunity to use a different word that has the same meaning in a sentence, so you are forced to use words that were programmed into the unit. It gets boring and frustrating after making the same mistakes and reading and listening to the same sentences."
The gamification makes me stick with it so I am learning rapidly. The content is presented in a practical order so I can actually apply the lessons speaking the language. I recommend Premium/family. The product has improved a lot over the years and the new feature allowing one to test out to get to the right level allowed me to give Dou another try and now I am hooked!
"The best free language learning app is one that offers a wide range of interactive and engaging lessons, practice exercises, and resources to help users improve their language skills. It should also have a user-friendly interface, personalized learning tools, and the ability to track progress and set goals. Additionally, the app should provide opportunities for real-world practice, such as conversation practice with native speakers or language exchange programs. Overall, the best language learn"
"This is an easy start to learning, however it is done through repetition as opposed to teaching. This could be much better with some more effort. Some of the tools are extremely primitive, for example you have to erase the entire sentence if you fat fingered an incorrect word. A better approach would be to allow reordering words. The complex sentences and phrases are often not explained or translated - it doesn't allow you to learn or understand the meaning behind the presumably slang phrases."
"I only recently started using Duolingo, but it is brilliant so far. I have learned so many Japanese words in a short amount of time. Duolingo is also very good at encouraging you to keep learning with fun lessons and a day streak system. am currently on 12 streak (12 days in a row). This helps motivate you, which is good if you struggle to stay motivated. I would highly recommend."
"At first, I felt embarrassed to try Duolingo. I want to be a translator and an interpreter, but as a person in college trying to finish my Associate's Degree, I've had some setbacks trying to reach this goal. But, when I got and tried out Duolingo, I felt more invested in it over time. I love how it encourages me to make mistakes and learn from the lessons about language. I also loved how it's set up like a game to improve at. Lastly, I love how many different features it has. It's great!"
It would be nice if you could test out of the kanji you already know. Having to review over and over and over until you get questions on the next set is so discouraging that I've been skipping the kanji practice entirely because of it. It's unusable. I wish the screen would rotate when I turn my tablet upside down so the charging port wasn't facing me and I wish that I could set the font size larger without parts of text or kanji getting cut off. I need bigger fonts to see.
"The actual learning is fine (I use the free version) but there are so many annoying and seemingly unnecessary and separate point systems for collecting diamonds, or hearts or streaks, or up grading your word collector. I still have no idea why these are important. And it pesters me and attempts to guilt me for not using the app everyday. Its a good thing overshadowed with a lot of unnecessary, confusing and unhelpful kitsch."
"I was enjoying the app and decided to accept the free trial offer. Play store shows that I am on the free trial as time ticks away..... yet I am getting no additional benefits of this ""super"" level of membership. Seems like it's either a waste or a glitch and I guess I'll be canceling because the ap offers zero support for issues. I haven't been able to find any way to get help other than warning the rest of you by leaving a review. üôÑü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"All tips, discussions, and guidance has been removed. Words aren't introduced anymore, they show up mostly in review units and I'm often expected to know how to spell a word I've never seen or heard before without hints. My streak has been broken more than once when I had done a lesson and/or had available freezes. Some languages have no audio or vowels so I've no idea how I'm supposed to learn anything. Endangered languages are abandoned and there's no resources to be found online or in app. üò´"
"After using DuoLingo premium for coming up to 3 years now, the app is a great starting place, covering the basics and sentence structure. Beyond this, it feels lacking and I wouldn't confidently have a conversation in a new language. The app was better in the old learning style, focusing on topics and allowing you to revisit them easily. You knew what you were getting into and where you were at. The new style of learning feels messy and the value has declined a lot. Goodbye 761 day streak :("
"Good app for basic learning and practice. It could be better with more details on verb tenses and conjugations guidance as well as pronouns. I would appreciate a quick reference popup when you get an exercise wrong that will take you to the appropriate description/lesson to explain why you got it wrong. Overall, a very helpful app."
"It's a money grab. The app isn't designed to focus on your specific language development. It gamifies your experience so you're distracted with leagues and points. You can't focus on your own development and non-competition use of the app isn't allowed. The AI-designed lessons don't focus on new material once you've learned something. App is designed to slow your learning experience so it takes you longer to learn the language, wasting your time and prioritizing profit first."
"It's a very good app for learning new languages. The only issue I'm having is that after the first exercise the app lags and doesn't record touches and it results in bad responses or the timer passes when I get to the last question. It's not a big deal but it's annoying. Plus loosing crystals for this issue is not that cool. üòï That's why the 4 and not 5 stars. But still, great job devs! LE: The 40xp challenges should really take into account if there are long translations. 1.30 is not enough."
"10/10 app that makes learning a new language fun and engaging. The lessons are easily digestible, flow nicely, and do a great job of reinforcing and building on each other. They offer a generous two week free trial for Super, which allows you to test and see if it's right for you. They also send you a courtesy notification that your free trial is about to expire, reminding you to cancel if you don't want to continue. The family plan is nice for the whole family to learn a language together."
"The new update makes the app load slow in between lessons and glitches often when trying to load that I earned the dual 2x exp. The new update now prevents from seeing how many units for future sections. I liked knowing what was coming up as it was much easier to manage my progress and accept how much further I still had to go. Once I make it to daily recap, super will be a thing of the past for me."
"This is an incredible resource for learning languages. Yes, you will likely need other resources for many languages, but Duolingo is such an effective tool for learning vocabulary and keeping the language you're learning fresh in your mind. It's engaging and offers vocabulary in ways that make it very easy to memorize new words in context. I would recommend this to ALL beginners as an incredible starting point! (Learning Japanese for 3mo @review)"
App is VERY aggressive about pushing notifications and reminders and other pressure mechanics such as streaks and icon that becomes ugly when not used in a while. A lot of time is wasted waiting for animations and other nonsense between lessons. Very frustrating. Be a good app and stfu. I'll use you when I get the time. Otherwise good teaching approach by gamification and quick bursts with rewards.
"Amazing for building a foundation in a language and building confidence. Mind you it's not to become fluent but it definitely helps push you there. Only problem is they practically only update Spanish and German (and a couple others). I understand there's higher demand, but for people like me learning less high demand languages (ie. Polish in my case) there's no updates ever. We don't have stories, speaking questions, nor grammar help. But other than that, great experience so far. Try it out! :)"
"This is rigged. I feel like the company makes exercises impossible, hoping I'll pay for more time. Words are included in timed exercises that I've never been taught. I really want to study Korean, but if I did, it's so much harder than the other three languages that I'd be sure to be demoted. This is so frustrating. I also wish explanations were given for exceptions to what otherwise seems to be the rule. And I wish we were taught to say practical, rather than nonsensical things."
"The app is great, I myself am not a native English speaker, Duolingo really helped me in learning English. But there's a catch, the thing is is that lately I started noticing how Duolingo after adding math lessons and piano lessons ‚Äî the app became really buggy.. It might be that it's because of the sanctions because I myself live in Russia, and a lot of apps started to have some problems. But I just want to ask the developers ‚Äî your app is great, if its just buggy then please fix it."
First the bad points: I wish it provided the option for English English not American English. I have to translate twice to get to the answer the app wants. There's no way you could learn a language on this app alone. Explanation is inadequate. It never gives the gender of nouns when you first encounter them which is bizarre and unhelpful. you move too quickly from one topic to the next to master them. As an experienced learner I have found some of the phrases new to me and very useful.
"This app got poor. They removed comments and a grammar explanation. It looks like it got more oriented on making money. Some courses look like they are not developing at all. And there are lots of errors like not giving you an extra 15 min for a level up lesson. It seems that they are really not caring about the reports. I sent lots of them, and if before, I sometimes was getting notifications on e-mail and mistakes and issues fixed - now the mistakes are staying the same."
"Buggy, just lost my xp-boost out of nowhere. Was finishing my level 3 quest and ended up with no reward. And there goes the weekly happy hour. Also DON'T BUY SUPER. ADDS after EVERY lesson. After trying duolingo super it started bombarding me with adds after the subscription went out. It was not like that before I got it, so I can only assum it was caused by my subscription running out. Made a ""quick"" 10 minutes session turn to 15."
"I'm still pretty early on but Duolingo seems to break it down in an easily digestible way that helps you remember each step rather than just moving on right away. there's a bit too many ads on non super which is why I gave it a 4 star, the family plan seems like a pretty good deal but I would have preferred if they had a month to month option rather then a yearly cost as I'm not sure if my family will remain commited once their chosen languages start to get harder and only year option is scummy."
"The audio is missing from the lessons. Impossible to learn pronounciation (I just started learning German in Duolingo but encountered this problem, making it much more difficult to study). I have to skip listening tasks because I've no idea what the audio's supposed to be. I don't think I will be using the app until the problem is fixed."
"TOO BORING! After I completed all the hindi units, all that is left in the course is 6 daily refresher lessons with the same set of sentences repeated like a broken record. No new vocabulary is introduced, and nothing you learned from the course is revised except the very last bit of it. In my case, I'm forever stuck in a loop of repetitive refreshers of the ""past tense"" in ALL SIX LESSONS which are clone lessons of the same grammatical rule with the same vocabulary, repeated DAILY! Demotivating"
"I love its conveniences - being able to turn off sound practices temporarily, and it will correct you when not using accents but doesn't require them for a correct answer (would take extra time typing). Previously didn't love there not being enough game elements but that's been super upped as of 2024. Another addition I love as a points junkie is earning experience by reviewing and mastering past lessons. Only current complaint is Oscar's the worst."
"The experience of learning is overall pretty good. Theres a bug where I'm stuck on Unit 9 of Section 3 of Spanish cause it keeps sending me back to the chest of Unit 8, also there should be a retire feature, your streak is frozen and you have to do all of the courses you sought out on doing. You should also be able to delete course data entirely (not reseting), per example, i want to delete my chinese course data, one day i started it for the memes and ended it the next one."
"No longer a fan, keeps getting worse. I am asked to type what I hear without seeing a translation of what I typed, a whole bunch of words are appearing in my lessons that I never learned before without showing what the words actually mean (which I then lose hearts for if I don't guess correctly), they took away reviewing mistakes which is helpful when learning, many phrases are ones no normal person uses, there is more memorizing words than learning, and the grumpy, emo characters are annoying."
"I've submitted bug errors 3x in the last week (with no response). Have had trouble with the audio on listening exercises, attempts to do a lesson and it kicks me out and then not receiving an xp boost when I had earned it and was given that notification. I'm thinking of switching to another language app or at least not pay to use this one."
"I like the gaming aspect of it. Play against other people for top positions. There is even a very rare achievement that I will get this Sunday: finishing #1 in Diamond league. You can definitely learn to speak a language with Duolingo BUT you have to always keep practicing. Not only with Duo, but also on other places (I use VRChat). What I don't like: Exercising is often repetitive. VERY repetitive. They don't have Thai. Free version sucks (one <3/4 hours). I really like Duolingo learning style!"
"Unless you read very carefully, you won't realize that when the free trial ends, there is only the option of paying for a whole year. The monthly amount is not what you actually pay but you have to pay up front for a whole year. I could afford monthly but an annual charge is beyond my capacity. So, I'll continue with the free version until I can find something less deceptive. I would gladly pay for it but not the upfront price demanded."
"I love it! Duolingo honestly helped me learn so much in just a week, plus the lessons are fun too, so it doesn't feel like some boring chore! It's built kinda like a game, and it bought my competitive side out to finish my lessons and earn a good streak and i look forward to the daily lesson everyday.and Its not to long so it doesn't take up more than 10 minutes of your time but it also depends on your speed, it's rlly good ! It's so good, I would highly recommend it. üëå"
"had low expectations, I assumed I would delete the app within a week of install. I've been pleasantly surprised, the notifications seem a bit much but in line with taking learning language seriously. and absolutely love that you can seamlessly switch to other language tracks. the lessons have been very basic so far but appropriate for where I'm at and I seem to be retaining... Will be trying a month of ""Super Doulingo' will update if things change"
"I faced a minor yet frustrating problem where answers contain extra details beyond the voice prompt. As a beginner, I encountered a Japanese question ""bengoshi to sensei,"" where I had to choose the translation. I picked ""lawyer and teacher,"" but it was marked wrong because I omitted ""a."" They need to implement their app with more possibilities that users can choose from. Instead of showing as a ""wrong answer"", showing as ""this is a good answer but an even better one is this""."
"the format works really well, mostly. it would be helpful to be able to make more spelling errors, it would be nice to earn more mistakes while learning, not by ads. nice to start a day with 10 instead of 5 most times I get the grammer backwards but it would be nice if the explanation of the grammar structure were in some of the lessons instead of just not knowing why you do or don't use this form of the word. but really if I make no learning ganes in a day its because Im not perfect!"
The streak and push notifications are very effective. Duo helped me jumpstart forming habits. It's not as technical and indepth as traditional language learning but you will definitely learn especially if you just want to spent a few minutes a day for language learning. I do miss the comments section after every question. It was quite disorganized then but the comments were helpful with the intricacies.
"Brilliant. Edit: Really enjoy using Super Duolingo but it's too expensive to pay in one lump sum. I think the developers can well afford to make it a monthly subscription instead of yearly - at the same price, not a rounded up price. I spent way more time using the app with the trial - your customers are worth more than advertisers. I'm knocking a star off on this basis."
"I'm gonna rate Duolingo a 4 stars because this is really great for people that are wanting to learn a new language especially for the beginners, and it realistically shows how long it will take for you to master it. and actual process. now you don't have to have a stressful time learning a new language in the internet or in books when you have dualingo there to guide and help you"
"I think, it's the best app teacher that teaches a language in a better way ,it helps me to learn different languages at the same time,it has also a reminder and rewards too,it helps me a lot to correct my pronunciation and it has a great setting for the practice or new words , everyday it teaches me some new words at the same time it also include practicing of the previous phrase"
"Awesome app! Duolingo is in its own class. I'd have rated 5 stars, but for a recurrent issue I've been experiencing. The app just says ""You are offline"", even when my connection speed is nothing less than 50mbps and every other app is connecting. It once cost me my streak..ü•≤. Please fix. Edit: So now this is getting very frustrating. The ""offline"" problem is getting worse."
"I wish they would help you with a list of all the vocab you've been introduced to and another for how much of it you mastered. Or maybe like a star system where the more stars that are colored by each word symbolizes how often you get it right or something. It would be so nice for review since I always run through the lessons and forget to write down the new words. Still though, the more often you practice, the better you'll get. Solid app."
"It's a great way to keep you on track especially if you're a little competitive and try to move up the leaderboard. Some of the phrases and things they teach however aren't what I would class as normal everyday conversation eg: who takes a bear with them to a party? But hey, that could be about learning different pronunciations for similar looking words."
"It's a very great app to learn languages. The recent addition of the widget makes it easier to do a lesson regularly and keep your streak alive! Duolingo Super makes the experience even better with some cosmetic, and the practice hub which helps me practice what matters! All in all, I like using this app a great deal! Screen time well spent!"
"Super user reporting in. My course doesn't have speaking exercises üëé or matching madness ones üëçüëç. Timed exercises are BS, especially getting 3*. You have to complete a set of exercises with a variance of 1 to 12 words each. Some require typing! Of course you always fall 10s short even if your speed would classify as blazing in normal exercises. Of course you can pay for time boosters üëé. Some listening exercises don't give you the correct translation. Can't upload a picture as avatar anymore"
"Terrible computer generated pronunciation of Mandarin. Also, the keyboard doesn't seem to be available on mobile as it is on the desktop. The speaking exercises are terrible and mark it correctly even if you completely butcher the pronunciation. Lastly, the app icon is sad and depressing which made me uninstall the app as no one to change that unless you upgrade to paid membership."
"üåé Realistically not great for travelling. I studied Duolingo for 3 months every day before going to Japan and was missing plenty of common vocabulary/phrases (ex. ordering at a restaurant, asking if I can use the restroom, asking for the bill, ""and"" sentences, ""or"" questions...) We should be able to skip from one circle too another (too repetitive). The fast match game is a very good idea."
"1. the sound effect is WAY LOUDER than the words being spoken. with sound effects on, you can not use the app on the bus or train. 2.the practice writing hiragana system is too forgiving. it doesnt train you to remember and accepts any squiggles as input. the constant 'f-u-pay-me' interruptions are bearable, and they give you a couple free premium days where the app is just nice. if the ads would just tell me how much money they want i might consider paying something, but they are just obnox."
"it works pretty well, and I'm learning steadily (I think!). I understand the desire to monetise the app, but i do think penalising mistakes contradicts the otherwise effective learning approach. It probably does make some people slow down and pay more attention though. Anyway, give it a go, I reckon!"
"Starts out fun and exciting, but when you get far enough, it stops accepting the correct answers so frequently that it sometimes becomes nearly unusable. I have reported several of these instances, but it feels like every day I report a new case where it fails to accept a correct answer. It is also the case that this app is fairly eurocentric as far as the languages that are well-supported. It might have been a better experience if I were to try to learn Spanish or German. I hope they improve!"
"I like Duolingo it's not a bad app and appreciate it being free, however I have one BIG complaint I wish they would change. I wanted to get the Duolingo pro and was hoping you could do a month or two. Unfortunately you can't it is a whole year at once or nothing. So a payment of over $80 and not monthly. I can't do that. I assume a lot of other people can't as well. Please make monthly payments? That would be really nice."
"Pretty good overall, but the speaking responses are difficult because the microphone doesn't register words correctly. I've had a couple that took my hearts away because the mic didn't pick up the words properly even though I got it right 3 times. I worked on it again the next day and it started flagging personal names as incorrect, which is ridiculous. It sucks because I'd like to practice speaking more, but it'll take hearts away and force me off the app if I try any with names in them."
"The app itself is very good, learning Spanish in Duolingo is really fun and interesting. One thing - a month ago or so I noticed that there's a bug with some listening exercises, where I should listen to what I'm being said and then write it down - sometimes there's no sound at all, and I can't complete the exercise or a lesson at all. Sometimes this bug appears and sometimes not, that's really weird and disturbing. 3 stars because of this bug."
"App is great, the only reason i give it 1 star is because the spoken exercises stopped working. Now everytime, the app immediately tells me that it didn't understand my answer when I click on the microphone, even though i didn't even have time to speak. If i try a few times it ends up giving me a mistake and removing a heart. Tried to update the app with no effect. I sent an email about this bug and never got any reply. I can't find another way to get techincal suport."
Great app. It's very easy to do your first steps into a new language with it. The learning units are short and motivating. I wish I could change my profile picture to a custom one but it's not possible on the app and also this feature has been removed from the desktop browser version. The duolingo avatars are really ugly and annoying. Would love to use my own picture.
"This is a very frustrating ongoing problem. When I am supposed to translate by tapping the words in ""bubbles"", the bubbles will either not work at all, leading me to have to quit and forfeit all of the work that I've done up to that point, because I can't move on from the exercise, or only one or two bubbles will go up, and no other bubbles will move, meaning that I lose points for getting it ""wrong"", even though the bubbles wouldn't move. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!! THANK YOU."
"It's pretty good if you're learning one of the popular languages (english, spanish, french, etc). But the other ones (danish, swedish, indonesian, finish, etc) are completely abandoned, with the same content as back when the courses were created by the community - except that they removed the grammar explanations. The social part and gamification are really good, but this neglect of some of the couses are very demotivating."
"The app and the lessons in themselves are great... BUT Since I'm not paying for ""super"" and I'm on a 100+ days streak.... I MUST watch their annoying AF plug for ""super"" EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Thus, missing out on a 4 week perfect streak, because the add HAS to play before you get your reward, meaning that I missed the deadline by 20 seconds."
"It's a good app but nothing really sticks. I'm a fast learner and understand most things quickly but nothing here has really stuck, maybe it's just me but.. it's good if you're just tryna learn somethin' quick before a trip but not good for full learning. It's also way too competitive and makes you focus more on moving up a league rather then taking your time and learning. It is a good app but just not for me"
"Perfect lessons, specific-language leaderboards, adding people, avatars aren't forced to everybody yet (And some people hate them) and these XP challenges are a cheat-trick to win leaderboards should all be fixed. Order: ""Perfect lessons"" are irritating. Specific-language leaderboards aren't really specific-language, as you can switch courses after you've already registered on the tournament on a course. Adding people is most of the time glitching and not working properly with an error message."
"I have tried learning Spanish with Babble but just couldn't get into it. It was just a chore. Duolingo is totally different! Duolingo is fun, it's engaging, I enjoy my daily sessions immensely, and as a result I am finally learning a language I have been interested in for years! I would recommend this to anyone wanting to learn a language!!"
"I personally think this app is a really greater way to learn basic and easy words of a language. However, there are two major disappointments of the app that being its not add- free and mean that you are interrupted after every lesson and can be a hindrance the other being a its streak reminder though I do appreciate it can be really annoying to be reminded however its not that troublesome overall the game is a great and fun daily activity you can add to just about anyone's schedule"
"Love this! although, I want to know if I'm saying things correctly, but it doesn't have a speaker button, if it does, please tell me. The only problem is it takes a while to load and get into the app. And the heart system is a lil not fun because if it's hard, you get more wrong so less time practicing. But overall nicely done!"
"The app is pretty buggy, at least on Android. I have found many very severe grammatical mistakes in the English translations of the my exercises, which is inexcusable for a language learning app. I have found some cases where vocabulary definitions change between translation exercises and writing exercises. It makes me wonder what kind of mistakes they are making in the material they are teaching."
"Great app to learn a language to a certain point, but there is no explanation whatsoever when it comes to grammar. It's useful for languages, where the grammar is quite similar to a language you already know, or if you already learned it somewhere else (e.g. back in school and want to relearn it). Otherwise you will need an additional professional learning class after you finished the basics. Edit: I tried to find out how much super access costs, and there is no way to do so through Duolingo."
"It used to be a fun and motivating little vocab and phrase app with forums for specific exercises which was very handy because you could discuss with real people why an answer is deemed ""correct"" or not and get explanations (which Duolingo doesn't do). Now the forums are gone, progress is super slow due to the lesson set-up, profession makes little sense, and you're bombarded with ads everywhere disrupting the flow of your progress after EVERY exercise... it's ridiculous!"
"I'm having fun with my Duolingo, but I have to say I'm really feeling unmotivated some days. Some questions I feel aren't explained very well. like silencent letters suddenly making a sound or what is and isn't a gender word. but overall, Duolingo still remains my favorite free language learning app, providing tons of bite-sized lessons and fun dialogs."
"Great app to learn languages using all possible senses like visual, sound, writing and some good explanations of nianses. And you can keep going with free-version for a really long time without a need for the paid one - only if you want to support the app, which is nice. Reasonable amount of ads, not bothering. Highly recommend Duolingo for your everyday 5-10 minutes of funny way of learning :)"
"Duolingo is a good language app. It's helpful to practice so the info enters your memory by repetition. But isn't challenging when it comes to seeing if you can remember new info without hints. I'm also not a fan of the subscription price, but I understand to some degree. Just wish there were more price options."
Duolingo is an amazing app that provides you enough privileges to achieve your goal. The adds are not so annoying and if you are not able to access super duolingo it doesn't matter. Duolingo still provides you the contents . The reason behind giving 4 stars to duolingo is it's been months I have downloaded the app and enjoying learning but I can't follow anyone. Every time I click on the follow button within seconds the access is denied. Hope the team will fix this problem soon.
"Ive started to use Duolingo back nowadays, for me everything is great however there seems to be a problem to interact with friends. For example, my messages won't send when i leave comments at feed. I have trouble to communicate with a friend since my replies wont send,i have been trying for days. I am looking forward to make new friends and chat with them as well as learn new languages on Duolingo. I hope you can fix this problem as soon as possible,your replies will be very much appreciated"
"Would rate higher if the Hebrew wasn't so buggy. The words review section has never had audio, it's a serious issue. There's no way to review your answers after doing a lesson. There are no statistics or way to chart progression. There is a real lack of word meanings and contextual information. Also I have premium membership but it doesn't really give much (it was a gift)."
"This app is wonderful for people who don't have a lot of time each day to spend on learning a language. I can take very short lessons each day and gradually build my vocabulary and understanding of grammar. Even after just a few lessons, they have introduced not just listening and speaking but also writing. I am able to add the language I'm learning to my keyboard so that I can get those important accent marks."
"it is a very good app and I'm currently working on some German and it is so good,the design of the language learning is designed as a game for more accuracy and interest. The features of this app is also that if you want to take notes after your first few lessons,it enables those words and their meanings in english and a pronunciation speaker so that you can take notes easily. I THANK DUO FOR THEIR UNDERSTANDING ENVIRONMENT. there are also 'stories' that I don't know yet,I hope I'll find out."
"considering the cost -free - Duolingo is the #1 way to learn another language, especially if you need to learn grammar and writing. Their pedagogy is aligned with the standards of many organizations and institutions. The app is structured to motivate and discipline you to study and practice as often as possible: key to acquiring a language. if your emphasis is conversational, Duolingo is still an excellent supplement, but not the best way."
"Helps me a lot especially with learning new languages. I'm proud to rate it 5 stars! this app deserves it! recommendations: it would help the future users to learn faster if the ads aren't too many and to explain on how to use the app. for example: to put how the system works. and should always put English translator. overall, thank you for creating this app! super helpful. and the app is FIRE!! it helps when you want to learn just for fun or for future traveling or also for interacting with pp"
"the latest changes completely changed the learning and advancement process, meaning that i went from having 9 different lesson sets in various states of completion to having most of those fully completed (without having learned most of the material sufficiently), and lost all progress on two lesson sets. Now you have no choice but grind through a single lesson set at a time, instead of working away at multiple at a time and returning to a lesson several times."
"This game is so much fun!! It has so many languages to learn, and the characters are well animated! You might not know it at first, but you'll eventually get to it. But I rated it only FOUR, because they have so many ads. But there is also premium, and Super Duolingo, which can make it better!! Trust me, it's like learning, but fun!! I would recommend, especially if your a child or adult wanting to learn for fun, for travel, and so much more!!"
"this is an amazing app! I'm learning Spanish right now, working on a longer streak, everything is great, but lots of people say they'd prefer being able to choose custom pictures as profile pictures instead of a pick and choose avatar, and I agree. I thought I'd be able to change it back to a photo and was upset when I couldnt. avatars are cool, but an option to change back to a photo would make it 5 stara imo! love you duo!"
"A bit off-putting My wife convinced me to download this app to learn a new language, her app icon has the normal icon and mine is an elderly version of the bird. I have looked into it as far as the widget looking ""tired"" the results aren't accurate. The only thing I have found says keep my streak alive and the bird will look normal. That said I currently have a three day streak and the bird still hasn't changed back. I strongly dislike this as it's a bit disturbing. Good tutor app though."
"I have a 75 day streak after joining about 5 months ago. at first I used the free version. It was OK, but since I decided to pay, I have found I can learn much faster and easier without all the interruptions and limitations. One of my finest investments! I very rarely pay to use an app, so it was a big decision for me. Am so glad, I have never found it so easy to learn a language. I love using the app and am often amazed when I realise I can remember words, and even.the spellings so well."
"I've been learning Spanish using Duolingo for 45 days. I'm so excited to be learning a language this quickly. I do anywhere from 10 mins to an hour every day, averaging 15 minutes. I love the cute little animations, the reminders, and the rewards to keep going. It's a great app, highly recommend. I am using the free version with ads which is tiresome but not too bad. I really wish their monthly rate was a bit lower or they had a discount after using it for a while. But $80 is cheap for education"
"I've recently hit 900 straight days and here's my thoughts on the app: -It works, and I'm getting better at the language I'm studying, little by little -The ads are pretty bad, sometimes it's faster to just quit instead of sitting through another repetitive ad. -Primarily, you want to pay to get rid of the annoying ads. -I got a free trial to the premium service, and it's actually worse than the free version. They ask for more money constantly, the daily tasks are worse, and the value is lower."
I don't want to complete each level individually there should be a streak option where when you start playing it keeps going until you end it (so from lesson one to two to three until you finish the unit). I don't want to keep starting a new lesson when it doesn't even teach you that many new things. just let me stay in the class.
"Amazing! some courses could use updating and more additions. There is also a slight issue with Duolingo teaching written instead of spoken (which you would hear on a day to day basis) in some languages. Overall though, it is great for keeping you motivated to learn. Super Duolingo is also a great addition!"
"I love this app it makes it easier to learn a language. Recently I've been seeing duolingos app icon look sad,old and like a melting Popsicle. I would love if you could fix the because its bothering me and some other people on tik tok. So please fix because I really don't want to feel uncomfortable going on my home page and seeing it. Its scaring me. Even on the play store it look old and saggy. But its an amazing app to learn a language on."
"Only app I will ever rate; Duo is too fun and effective! I have learned two languages and am always excited to utilize the platform (on top of my other paper & pen methods). A fun, natural, and organic way to learn, plus I adore the animations! It feels like a little learning family. When I can afford the subscription, I absolutely do, if only to support the creators. Thank you Duo team!! Keep excelling and sharing your encouraging-learning ways! ü§çüß†‚ô•Ô∏è"
I paid for a subscription and have been using this app for months. They just changed the icon to this ugly frowning owl. Since there is absolutely no way to contact the developer via the app I uninstalled and reinstalled and now all of my history is completely wiped out. Shouldn't be the case if they have the lessons on their database. But I guess I was wrong about that. Why they changed this to an unmotivating unattractive icon is beyond me. Nobody wants to see this type of face.
"I have tried throughout my life to learn another Language. at 40 years old I can say Duolingo is fun and helps you to learn no matter what style of learning, visual, listening, speaking. I upgraded as Im taking the new language a bit more serious for traveling and future plans and its well worth it but the free version is just as good."
"A really great and fun app for learning languages. The structure of the lessons, repetition, and appealing animations. However some features have been buggy or hearts not refilling sometimes. It's a bit frustrating to lose progress sometimes, but overall this app has helped facilitate my language learning immensely."
"I'm having an issue the last 3 days. It is not accepting speaking exercises consistently. It almost seems to lag. I'm having to do them multiple times and sometimes it fails out. I have updated the app and restarted my phone. I tested it with Bluetooth headphones. It does not appear to be an issue with my phone. I had my boyfriend try doing exercises too, and he has the same result on my device. His is fine. I'm having to use freezes to preserve my streak."
"Seems like an adequate learning app for a second language, but unless you pay Duolingo, the commercial down time spent waiting for the next question hampers learning enough to be discouraging. After their promotion to learn without commercials ended, Duolingo asked me again for a subscription, which I declined. That day the app's icon changed from a happy, bright faced bird to a saggy, sad and tired old bird. Seems like there's some subliminal manipulation there.ü§î"
"Practice makes perfect. You will get out of it, what you put into it. These are two phrases you will hear throughout your life. They are the key to success in all we accomplish. Duolingo makes my goal of learning a 2nd language possible. If you practice hard, study hard, you will learn with Duolingo! It is fun, edgy, and the best learning product for language I have come across on the market. Enjoy! Spacibo!"
I often experience being corrected on correct answers. Like for example i answered the correct sentence construction but surprisingly i will be receiving an incorrect remark but when i double check i answered correct answer which is the same from the correction. I am starting to get disappointed on this app the only thing that is making me stay is for quick review on my missed lessons but overall i feel like uninstalling.
"it's a fun and easy app, I just started and in less than an hour I've already learned 25 words in the language I chose to learn for fun. I highly recommend this app for people who have trouble learning new languages. this app is very engaging and is extremely helpful especially to me because I have a learning disability. it's super accessable and easy to start up, and the social media makes it more humorous and enjoyable my one main hope is that Duo can come to my wedding one day, but we'll see!"
"I really wanted to learn somali for work, and downloaded this hoping it would have, but it is not included in list of available languages. However I have been using it to learn others for funzees, and has been very easy and fun to use. I would really like to see somali added to the lessons as it is becoming more common in my area and there aren't many apps as good as this one."
"I'm learning German. The course more or less ignores articles (der die das), revision is very weak (you quickly forget what you've learned), translations it accepts are very inflexible (i.e. a hundred is wrong but one hundred is correct) and when translating sentences, pay special attention to genders. At least half of the characters used in examples are gay and it gets confusing. While I don't particularly regret paying for a year in advance for family plan, I won't be renewing."
"Great way to learn new languages for free. A nice way to make it a game and memorable. I'm flying through 3 languages at the same time and I never saw myself as the person who could do that. 4 stars only because I'd like a better ad experience with relevant ads. lessons feel a little too long, but I suppose there's real scientific approach to it."
"Its a great app but it drags on before you can complete an exercise which makes it feel tiresome. I also think there should be a level test so that you can be placed at a level that challenges you or is relevant to your level. languages are a conversation, so maybe there needs to be more of that in practice. That's my point of view anyway."
"I enjoy Duolingo well enough and have been using it for years, but I've found the addition of lives as well as AI translations has made the app less helpful and less accurate. I'm disappointed. Beforehand, I had considered getting premium but now Duo is really only useful to me for brushing up on basics or a time killer rather than proper language learning."
Found that coming back to Duolingo after using Drops/Pimsleur/tutors and meetups. The app really helps me now. Was really hard to learn Japanese with this app in the beginning but it's changed a lot and now has great progression and features. Friend quests and the daily quests really help. I use Paul Noble to learn speaking/pronunciation too. Good combo. Full immersion is best though.
"I've been on this app at least 7yrs. I can assure you I can speak virtually as much of the foreign languages I'm learning as well as I did when I started this app. I.e. It's not the least bit effective at learning to communicate. That being said, it is a fun app, & I have marginally gotten better about hearing certain things, and significantly better at reading things. They emphasize too much on grammar/ spelling/vocab as opposed to comprehension and communication."
"Love your widespread learning mission for all! You're open to my questions for correct sentence acceptance. Duolingo is so wonderful in learning and supporting us!! I would love to provide more feedback on the different languages, though. I am active with over 10. I believe I can add value to better learning if I have the ability to provide input. Thank you!!"
"It's become something of an industry standard now to hold a free trial hostage behind an uncancelable auto-renewal agreement. And every app knows very well that a substantial percentage of users will forget to cancel when the trial ends. You cannot contact Duolingo about this, and just have to pray the refund bots at Google will ordain you a refund for the purchase you did not want. Enough already with these cynical gotcha subscription scams."
"I like the way that it still brings up words in old lessons so in that way, you could never forget about them. Overall a great app but i do come across this bug very often--- Currently, the words and sentences do not make a sound. I can't hear any words but i can hear other noises like the noise when i get a question right; as a person who very much relies on hearing to understand, it makes it so much more difficult."
"Usually, individuals learn through repeating. Duolingo does this, AND Duolingo has you spelling and speaking the words over and over again. There are conversations in which you follow and answer questions. Yes, you can press on a word throughout the program, and it will show what word it is in your language. You can ""team up"" with friends and cheer each other on or compete. After each lesson, scores are shown immediately. Have free fun learning at your own pace!"
"This app here, I can say helps you learn many of the international and national languages. Guys, i 100% recommend it. Go for it if u want to learn a language seriously, and it provides many practice sessions thats gonna be so helpful so that you don't forget what uve learnt. Not only for kids but even for adults who wanna get new skills or people who are interested in learning new languages ( like me) it's for you. All the best with learning. ‚ù§Ô∏è Thankyou for such an amazing app."
"Fairly good on the whole but this app does have plenty of annoying deficiencies and inconsistencies with odd translations, strange sounding English, very limited explanation of grammatical rules, and little idea of new words. The worst problem is that the app often messes up the page layout on my phone to hide some or all of the answer fields so it's impossible to answer or complete it. Or it just locks up at the end of an exercise, again forcing me to quit losing the xp I've earned."
learning path is more linear now which is nice. i like being able to see and work more on mistakes ive made. the heart system seems counterproductive and the price for ad free and full functionality seems high but app has seemed effective. I'm a month into learning spanish and feel like ive actually learned a decent amount. nothing beats having native speakers to work with though
"UPDATE: Thank you for all the changes. I love the reading parts! To be able to listen to the words by clicking on it is awsome! üåü Previously: It is better now. I would like to read too, but with the correct pronunciation ...easy things at first. I find the ""tips"" valuable... one remembers better if you know the language rule."
"I can just say that we use this application with my wife, on dayly basis, and we love it. This is such an amazing and interesting way of learning any new language :) It's like a funny game, but with the reward of been able to communicate with people in places you haven't been, in their own language, without any troubles and the feeling is just something special. I'm recommending this app to any travelers, preparing a new destination! Or it can be just for fun or any other random reason ^^ Enjoy!"
"The app is really fun and helpful. I just got this a few days ago and I absolutely love it. It helps you learn any language you want Spanish, French, etc. This app really helps me learn fast because I already know some Spanish! You can compete on leaderboards, make avatars, and obviously learn languages etc. If your willing to learn a new language I'd definitely recommend this."
"What in the world happened with this app ? I took a break for a month and now that I'm back I get an ad after EVERY lesson(almost all of them to get the super duolingo plan). Also, the animations are now completely broken. Please fix this asap, I used to love this app. And please, cut the ads in half, I understand you need to make money but am ad after every lesson is way too frequent."
"Duolingo is a pretty good app to use to learn multiple languages, but some downfalls are that you can only use duo music on IOS which isn't fair to Android users because I would like to learn duo music, the fact that you have to do a lesson every single day gets annoying especially if you are busy, and that earning XP is difficult unless you use an XP boost. We should also have more options in the shop to buy things because I have so many gems unused but other than that, it's a good app to use!"
"it was really good but now I'm learning how to discern the ends of words to fit an amount of people in different views and Duo hasn't taught me the words so I'm just repeatedly making mistakes and not really learning anything, I'm just rage quitting and just doing heart lessons. if this can be fixed so that people know what the words are that would be really great but until then I'm only getting three stars for this."
"Its ok but even if you pay $79 for the plus version, they changed it so you run out of hearts then have to pay if you want more or watch ads or do extremely basic Spanish practice like name colors to earn more. I cancelled my subscription. For just a little more you can get Babbel or another more complete language learning app. I don't think the paid version is worth it anymore."
"I've been using Duolingo for over a year now and have found it an easy and fun way to pick up German again. I don't know how it would be for someone who didn't have any experience with a language, and you won't get fluent using it, but it's working well for my purposes. I used the free version for a year, then switched to the paid version, and I probably could have stuck with free so I may switch back when the year is up."
"Love the solid applied learning theory! It's effective. Default notifications are a little too aggressive, but I could easily dial it back to a comfortably annoying level so no stars were removed. I know as an educator the value of a little nudge to keep students engaged, and total silence would be less effective. L'attrito accende la fiamma! (Friction kindles the flame!) PS. Earned my 30 day streak app icon and my saggy owl icon is like Reek's bath üõÄ. (üòè Nice UX nudgery!)"
I'm not sure it suits my learning style. It's just rote learning with no explanation of why phrases are the way they are coupled with the rote method being used just not having the repetition required for the lessons to stick. 1+ year update: current frustration is the gamification combined with objectives that require 90% score to count towards rewards. Two incorrect translations routinely gets you 89% resulting in no progress towards that timed reward. Literally just coninuing out of habit.
"excellent app if you want to learn a language incorrectly. Duolingo offers a robust hint feature that provides you with the wrong answers and then marks you wrong with minimal guidance. Luckily, you can always flag when the app has glitched and in 3 to 5 business days, nothing will have changed try duolingo premium if you want to not learn a new language faster"
"Duolingo was great two years ago, but now it feels like they're focusing more on money than teaching. I am in Section 9, and they are just using the same 20 words over and over again. And, they keep making it where you have to complete 50 quests for each badge, and it's making it where I focus more on the quests than actually learning. (I wrote this on April 5th, 2024, and I know I got WAY more than 6 quests, I have completed two quests every day and haven't missed a single day.)"
"I've loved this app and pay for the family plan, but the updates to the Chinese course have been very frustrating. Many past lessons have been updated with brand new vocabulary, and they're marked as completed for me with no easy way to go back and redo the lessons to make up what I've missed.."
"there's something very sweet about duolingo... it's not overly monetized, yes there are ads and it will occasionally promote the paid version, but it doesn't restrict any of the core features and lessons if you opt to stay free. there is a lot of gamification to encourage you to stick with daily lessons, which I can appreciate since the goal is to help you learn."
Pros: 1-the system encourage you to keep learning 2- it helps in memorising vocabs 3-it makes studdying a habit and it's easy to contiue as it's small lessons even at my worst time it was the only thing that could do . Cons: 1- it doesn't explain grammar nor pronouncation. 2- the translation is not accurate and sometimes it's even wrong.. Personally i don't like the hearts no the league thing as it's destract me and makes focus on usless things as xp points and what's so on
Super annoying how pronounciations are so buggy. In Japanese I sometimes enable them with Hiragana but they will show up Romanized. Even when disabled if I open the app from a notification reminder - pronounciations will be showing. This basically nullifies the exercise and I have to force quit the app. Edit. This is getting worse and worse. STOP SHOWING PRONOUNCIATIONS HINTS!
"At first, this app was great fun, and I have learned a lot. BUT, the leader board concept makes no sense - how is it even possible to have 16,000 points in less than 24 hours? Something is very wrong. Also, every single practice lesson has exactly the same questions, and quite frankly, apart from being bored, my learning has slowed down to a crawl. Maybe it's time to look for another option."
I used to love this app. It is now a HORRIBLE app for language. It doesn't explain spelling be requires you to type on a phone that autocorrects and frequently counts typos wrong. Absolutely awful It! Moreover it keeps changing courses so you miss vocab and then get it all wrong because it is a whole new progression. I have nearly broken my phone in frustration several times. It seems this app only cares about those that pay and wants to push competition. Atrocious!
"I like the app, as I once had a 339 streak on duo, but in my opinion, there should be a way to refund streak freezes I bought. I spent it all on freezes and only after realised I could of saved my streak using 500 gems to repair it. Obviously, if you lose a streak most cases it's the person at fault, but seeing I could of saved it if I didn't spent it on freezes frustrates me. I could of saved it with using money but for free users and for super users this way would surprisingly really help."
"This is a wonderful app, it has so many features and I am surprised you are doing this for free. Even kids like me are very interested in the app in ways like how it works and look, many achievements to keep us going and leagues to keep us competitive and concentrate on the language better. Overall I think it is the best language learning platform."
"Good overall app for learning a language, however, there's is a distinct lack of explanation throughout lessons. for example specific words in Spanish that mean the same thing such as Todos and Cada. it is not explained, at least early on, when it is appropriate to use which soecific word. Explanations throught it's courses need to be more detailed and and in greater supply"
"I used to love this app for learning languages but now it give you hearts, so if you make 5 mistakes, you have to wait until the next day to play. Hard to learn a language that way. On top of that, it tries to encourage you by complaining when you don't use it often, but it's kinda hard to use when I only have so many failed attempts and have to pay for more hearts in order to learn. I feel they lost their goal of teaching language somewhere and tried to make it a game."
"Thank you so much Duolingo team for helping me use my time productively, considering how much time I used to waste. It's an Amazing app, actively helping me learn Mandarin & Japanese while also allowing me to brush up my French. Although I would like to bring to notice, the changes in course in Mandarin is a pretty weird one, starting with foods & all in Unit 1 while in prior versions it was actually introduction & a number knowledge which was much better before this current revised syllabus"
"It was fun at first but they keep changing the courses while you are on it and you keep losing your progress so you will never end the course regardless how persistent you are Also, it lacks on a practical level, you may understand the language but wont be able to answer simple question in a conversation Lastly, They need to improve explanation of grammar rules"
"I have a few comments on this app ranging from best to worst 1. The app can be fun to use cuz im learning 2. The ads are funny and I like it a lot 3. Why doesnt Android have the music and math update thats hyped up recently? I really wanna try the music one, but it isnt available on this device 4. The ads def dont help, but my work/home/school life make it hard to have any alone time, and I tend to pass out before I can even get 5 mins to myself and im afraid of losing my streaks! Stressful üò≠üò≠"
"At first I didn't care much for the new update but it's a very helpful way to learn Spanish for free easy to get your kids practicing on it as well and fun enough to keep them interested. would like more challenges and games with friends, maybe a fun Spanish game where you can play like hangman or something with a friend through the app. or like a time word find and finding words in Spanish"
"I've been at Spanish for over a year, learning casually. After a year, lessons can be very similar to prior lessons from the beginning. Which is frustrating. I don't expect to be fluent through learning on Duolingo, but it's disappointing how incredibly slow the lessons go. Ultimately I'm irritated for filling in the word ""o"" for ""or"" this far along. Some words &phrases simply don't need to be repeated as much as they are. I also don't need Duo requiring me to spell names like ""Laura"" üôÑ"
"Those new profile drawn things replacing pictures is strange and shouldn't be forced.Especially when you're Paying for using the app. Also would be better if we can learn more useful everyday words and not ""ants newspaper"" and ""foxes donut"". A few voice recordings were impossible to understand and sounded very bad. Timed exercises do not extend time when you go from just letters to full on sentences and are impossible to complete on time allocated making it an anxiety induced lesson and not fun"
So many problems but they'd rather implement stupid features. Overall it's awful but t's free. I lost a bunch of progress on legendary challenges so I wasted a ton of gems for no reason. The useless support team offered literally no assistance so I gave that up. I still can't understand why they took away discussion boards and replaced them with nothing. I'm glad it's free and will continue to use it but I certainly wouldn't pay for it. It really seems like the team doesn't care abt the product.
"Good service for learning languages but you may need something in addition. However, invasive adverts and hearts on the free service are getting to be a bit much and they are blatantly trying to get you onto their subscription plan. Would be ok but it's a bit off to have to set the volume to a comfortable level for lessons only to have your ears blasted by the following advert. Now down to one star due to inappropriate opinions being foisted on the users."
"I still wish we could see some information as to why we missed something. You're wrong, isn't exactly helpful or informative when learning. Also, can we stop handing out XP boosts like candy and make them a usable item that we can use at our leisure. It feels like you're trying to force us to do more than we want, instead of allowing us to decide how much we want to do. I remember when we could choose how aggressive we wanted to be with our journey, now we are forced down a path, chased by a üêª"
Good UI design thats simple and effective which goes far nowadays compared to so many terrible designs nows. Just started spanish so not sure about later modules but starting off is great. However the audio recordings of spanish speakers is terrible. Like they hired someone who never spoke it before or is not fluent. Prefer to have it from someone who has it as a native language if possible. Would like to avoid being absolutely ridiculed by other spanish speakers for butchering their language
"Duolingo, a decent learning app! Of course, it's not the best, but it is only meant to start you on a language. It's courses are easy to understand and the repetitiveness of them makes it splendidly easy to remember what it's teaching you. I do wish that there were still comments on lessons because people were able to list efficient resources, but I'm sure Duolingo had its reasons to remove them. There's also the issues of occasional lag, but it isn't horrible. Thank you Duolingo, and Good day."
"Duolingo is a fantastic app to learn languages. I would rate this 5 stars but the main problem I have is that when you get to any of the checkpoints Duolingo gives you a short test and the test has incredibly hard stuff that it hasn't even taught you yet. This is a big let down for me. If this is changed I may consider changing my rating. Edit: The app should also include a setting to disable all speaker sound for itself, as to allow for individuals to play their own music in the background."
"Experience user with 1.5 years use: 1) Offline no longer available even for paying subscribers. Naturally I used to study a lot when traveling since I can focus on the flight and I was motivated to study, but now offline lessons aren't even available if you buy the expensive subscription. 2) Lesson quality gets much lower as you progress. 3) Audio is unreliable and often doesn't work. 4) Speaking exercises never work. Support doesn't care."
"It's an overall good app if you really wanna LEARN a language. The courses are well designed and all that. Only there are too many ads, and it asks for premium at the end of almost lesson, otherwise shows an ad. Even if u don't fix that, could you pls add that good old feature where you could skip some lessons if you have been doing good at the previous lessons. It'd be a great help. Keep up the gud work guys üëç"
"Have used this app for and seen it through many changes. Wanted to write this positively but have been stuck in the same unit in the same spot for about 9 months. No matter what I do, every couple days I get a notice saying they are resetting my progress. So basically I've done the same lessons hundreds of times at this juncture handicap progress in the course. A learner's nightmare. This would be great if they could address the bugs."
"I can't recommend this to anyone. I started learning Korean and grabbed Duolingo to drill through the basic sounds and solidify the consonants, but immediately lost hearts to an incorrect audio on „Ñ± and Îì± in the first lesson. You're setting people up for confusion and errors in the most basic and foundational level and now I don't feel I can trust this at all for language learning."
"Nice + motivating. It teaches basic vocabulary for everyday use. However, it lacks grammar + syntax rule-explaining (I am taking the French course and I'm able to understand most of it, because I already know a little since high-school); I am glad with it, although for a real novice it should be more difficult. Also, the app can be a bit glitchy, I've lost twice 50-gems achievements awards - glad that I haven't paid for it. Therefore, it's a good starting point, but not the whole picture."
"I really loved this app but it's not been working properly recently. Whenever the listening exercises come, they don't have their audio as a result i have to skip listening exercises. Same is the problem with speaking exercises. Pleases fix this bug. Other than this bug, its a great app for learning any language and i love it but please fix this problem as soon as possible"
"Bug found in Android. Cannot progress past Section 2, Unit 13 because of a bug that will not let me type in the space provided for my answer. I have screenshots. Have reported via the app and via email. Please respond. Update: it's been over 24 hours and I still cannot progress/use my app. I am also losing my 3 free days of Duo Plus. I can't skip the Unit without taking a test that I can't pass because I haven't learned the information. Dropping my star rating to 2. It will drop to 1 next."
"The app is great learning practice, UI is pretty good, and the lessons are fairly helpful in advancing my language proficiency. A large part of how I am able to maintain this streak is the in app reward and incentives system. My favorite and most motivational reward is the ""streak mile stone"" Phoenix animation. However, since the recent update I have hit multiple streak mile stones and not received the Phoenix animation. I wish to see that reward return."
"Phenomenal. I know people grouch about the dialect differences in say French and Spanish, but for a difficult to access language (for me) like Vietnamese, this is unsurpassable. I am unable to use accents in my typing - without switching the whole phone to Vietnamese. Maybe I will do that for lessons if it becomes necessary to progress. The diversity of lessons, the graphics, sound effects, enunciation. I really cannot fault it. Using at the behest of my 6 year old grandson. His mum EXPECTS it!"
"Duolingo is an excellent language-learning app! I've found it incredibly helpful in improving my language skills. The interactive lessons make learning feel like a game, and the variety of languages available is impressive. The progress tracking feature keeps me motivated, and I appreciate the flexibility to learn at my own pace. Overall, Duolingo has been a fantastic tool for learning new languages, and I highly recommend it to others."
"You're learning platform is the best. However, your platform may loss its prestige because of some bug and I want you to know this so you can avoid it. Sometimes in game, when I tap the words on the blank, it can't be tap because of the bug. That causes me to loose heart. Overall, your app is really good, keep it up!"
The app is good. But I do wish it did more explaining about the grammer when something is being said a different order or way then we would in english. It's still a great app but I have to use other sources to piece things together on more grammer rules of why something is said the way it is. Also sometimes I feel the levels are so repetitive it takes a while til you get a new word again.
"Generally great but a few annoying things. Sometimes the English translations are not what someone who speaks English would say and sometimes when a meaning is similar there does not appear to be anything to differentiate, but they will mark incorrect if you choose the wrong one. For example you ...... is it Tu or vous, it's 50 50 if you get it right! friend is both ami and copain. Google translate says copain is boyfriend, but duolingo doesn't seem to differentiate."
"LOADS OF BUGS! I have premium subscription but for some reason it won't let me manage. I have two premium accounts, they have different interfaces in the same app. In same version same device. It's beyond my understanding. Also reinstalling the app will sometime loose your rewards. In monthly quests sometimes my quest numbers decrease. How?? I have no idea. Tried to contact the support but no reply. I am a serious learner I also had payment issues from web, also I can't upload any photo as pfp."
"Hmmü§î Well, it makes studying foreign languages more fun and interesting than it was for me using other apps like Rosetta Stone and even Babble. It gives me the push I need to be consistent. It also supplies you with various quantitative data sets that you can use to track your progress. It's pretty good, plus you can use the app for free. ü•∞üòÑ"
"When I moved to a new phone, duolingo said something about servers or connection not working, even though it worked fine on my old phone which was over 10 years old. I also had no problems with the Internet in have in the past, with and without my new phone, so I'm not sure what the problem was. This went on for weeks, until it suddenly wanted to work."
"It's very fun but I feel like I am not learning as much as I Should , Or I'm just not remembering it So when I get to the next level I FEEL confused and I have to kind of backtrack a little , or click on eacj word in said sentence just make sure that I understand exactly what's being said. Also, I think that there should be more conversations. I can match words easily, obviously by sound, but the understanding in a conversation is a little harder. Especially when they speak fast. ILOVETHISAPP‚ô°"
"I'd have given a complete 5 but recently, I've been stressed by Duo. Anytime I want to play, it always says that I'm offline and it's annoying that I have to put on airplane mode, put it back on after minutes and it's still the same. I haven't been able to compete on leaderboard and have been loosing my streaks. Plus the fault is not from my end. Please, help solve the problem."
"So far so good. I don't like the ads but they do not interrupt a lesson, they come after some lessons. The app is generous in giving away their paid version if you play enough. They gave me 3 days for free after playing for about 8 days on their app. This is not to be confused with the 1 week trial. I do think I am learning and retaining a lot. I can now listen and understand fast speakers. This app feels more helpful to me after a week than the Spanish I took in school for an entire semester."
"Okay first off, love everything about this app. The accessibility, the art, the memes. BUT one thing I would want changed is how long the units are. Sometimes I'll finish a unit then not have everything engrained in my brain and it's frustrating because I can't focus on the next one. It also demotivates me to do lessons because I can't focus. So basically that's the only thing I would want changed. Great app overall though! <3"
"The Duolingo learning approach really suits me. I prefer the oral and aural approach rather than focusing on learning written vocab. I have now spent 5 weeks learning a new language and feel I've made good progress. I couldn't hold a conversation but do stand a chance of understanding what is being asked. That being said, learning about some of the grammar would also be helpful, which has been completely lacking so far."
"Duolingo makes learning a language really fun! I had it before when I tried learning French, but eventually uninstalled it because it wouldn't let me log in. I'm so happy I re-installed it though, as I can now learn Japanese! The app itself is easy to use, and there are many options of languages to learn. I also quite like the new character maker! It makes the app seem more personalized. Hope this helps if you're considering downloading üòä"
"It is fun to learn another language with Duolingo. The app allows you to go at your own pace but challenges and encourages you to do more? It also varies the ways it introduces new and reviews old learning through words matching, sentences, stories, listening, speaking etc. I enjoy the weekly league and friend challenges as they encourage me to practice regularly too. All in all, Duolingo helps to build my vocabulary and confidence in using my new language."
"Using it to learn Portuguese. It's ok but not nearly as good as it used to be when I was learning Swedish a few years ago. A lot of features have been removed (not having the discussion feature is a big set back). Now feels very lack lustre and has lost its sense of community. I've had a number of sentences to translate where the ""correct answer"" is completely wrong. I dont recommend paying for this app as you dont get anything of real value that you dont already get from the free version."
"If I could I would rate a 3.5, this app is really great! But if you don't have the super learner subscription you only get a certain amount of hearts (how many mistakes you can make) and if you have a certain amount of mistakes you can't use the app until the next day. The lessons for the alphabets are really good! but during normal lessons, it will give me a random word that has never popped up and I have to click the right translation, which I always get wrong because it never seen it."
"My opinion of the app has been dropping a lot lately. Removing the sentence discussions has been a huge loss. I made heavy use of those to understand mistakes or sentences I didn't quite get. Now, many mistakes. Leave you confused and with no explanation or way to figure out what you did wrong. Overall, duolingo is not a bad app for supplementing language learning. However, it falters as a primary source and it seems to be getting worse and not better."
"Hi Duo! I've been using the app for almost two years and I can say is that, it helped me get closer to various languages and it gives me the opportunity to learn more. It's just that, I hope you can add the Croatian language, which infact is one of my favorite language. Moreover, please fix the no sound issue which was given already by the user who gave a review, and..m that's all. Hope youve red this one Duo!"
"I enjoy learning another language through duo. I have opted not to pay so put up with the adds..wish all adds were honorable. the repittion is good, the rewards and encouragement helpful. the few times you get the unlimited temporarily gives you the taste of the payment....tempted. It is fun to try to keep up the daily streak. The challenges with the new language when the order of words change. it would be nice to have a grammar section like there is the alphabet section. It is a good app"
"I love Duo, the only problem is that as they update the app, they add things into the earlier levels. In theory, this is great, except if you're already past that point you don't get a chance to learn it. And then, when you get review questions about it, you have no clue despite supposedly having learnt it before. It would be great if they'd add in a section to review newly added things in earlier levels! As it is, it's quite frustrating. I paused a lesson to make this review because of this!"
"Duolingo is a fantastic way to learn Spanish, by having you practice all the ways you will be engaging with it...listening, speaking, reading, & writing. By giving some answers to choose from, you have higher success as you build your knowledge, then when you have gotten to practice a word, phrase, or sentence structure, it will have a ""fill in the blank"" and check your memory. Just the right balance between encouraging & challenging your knowledge. And you immediately see the correct answer."
"The app is easy to use and interactive, but the units are LONG and the amount of repetition (repeating the same thing a MILLION times) makes this app extremely BORING!! I may have repeated the same word at LEAST 60 times. The repetition discourages me to focus, learn and memorize but instead encourages me to just try to finish the lesson as fast as possible. Unless they fix these issues I would NOT recommend this app to first time users."
"I'm using the app to learn japanese which is super difficult so I actually have multiple accounts but this is by far the best app out there and I've tried quite a few, also the family plan is the best deal out there when it comes to language learning apps. I also love the way they use the duolingo owl for marketing and I love the way they embraced the memes made about them, and I love the owls energetic and pushy but friendly energy!"
"This app is soo good ! I leant a lot of languages ‚ú®‚ú® but now the problem occurs last I open the app the data was on but it showed me that I'm in offline, the whole I whenever I opened I have full data but is showing offline so fix this problem I couldn't use the app üòë, then for each and every lessons there ate a lot of ads first it was ok , but now it wad for 30 sec ,two ads for 25 sec it's üôÑ irritating so duo , pls fix the problem as soon u can üòä"
"An amazing app;it really is. The animation is good and the voice is also not bad and the lessons are really good. My two stars are held because the leaderboard doesn't help, especially in the diamond league,gaining thousands of XPs and not knowing a thing;we are here to learn not to compete. Being demoted while learning more is really really discouraging. I hope the changes are made, thanks Duo."
"Not a fan of the latest update to the Chinese curriculum. I kept my progress level, but the lessons themselves changed - so now the app thinks I've learned so much stuff that I haven't yet. And because I had those lessons at Legendary, I can only review the lesson - which means I have to blindly guess at what everything means."
"App only keeps deteriorating over time. Went from a format where I could go back and practice, now I have to hope something shows up again. This is not a learning app. Also, monthly quest points sporadically either stick, or don't, when earned (they can't even do basic programming function anymore)."
"Gamification of learning isn't very helpful... less about the learning and too much emphasis on getting points. Each ""improvement"" reduces its value as a learning tool. Was once a great app... the decline accelerated with the structure changes. You totally lost track of what you had done and where you were up to. At least users could have been given the option of the long-standing pathway or choosing the strange new path. Poor pedagogy seems to be entrenched."
"I am studying several languages on Duolingo. It has its ups and downs. On the positive side it can be a lot of fun. Some of the stories and sentences make me laugh out loud. They cover an immense amount of vocabulary and it takes time to absorb and retain it. Yet, with consistent effort, the understanding of a language and the ability to use it increases. They explain some grammar but not all one needs to master a language. I use other sources to fill in the wholes. It works!"
"he may have kidnapped my family a few times but other than that this is a really helpful app. I'm learning polish so I can communicate to another friend of mine, and this is teaching basic stuff to learn. I've only just started, and it's surprisingly addictive because it's so simple and easy and because it brings streaks and levels into the mix, It makes me want to play more. Great app, and who ever wants to have a fun time learning a different language, I suggest you use this app."
"So far I'm using the free version with ads, but this app is much better than any other language learning method I've tried. I'm learning Japanese, and the one thing I really wish it did better is have the Japanese Characters learning section offline. The normal lessons are available offline, but the symbols are not. Otherwise great app!!"
"The app is great, I have been doing Spanish for quite a while and it has actually taught me Spanish.One problem with the app is that is can get laggy at some moments but usually passes. Another problem is when doing a lesson only sometimes their animated effect is applied but other times it's just normal UI."
"I have been using Duolingo for 99 days straight. It took about a month to figure out how to use the app (no instructions). I had a question and had to go on their website to find customer support. I sent my question and never got a reply. Not very good customer support. Overall, I am happy with the app and I am learning a second language (I am 74 years old). The lack of customer support is why I only gave 4 stars."
"I understand that they need ads to fund this but I wish they did more reward for an ad kinda thing. like gain a xp boost after 2 ads or something. This is a very fun app, it's very repetitive, which I thought was annoying but how else would I remember it? Duolingo has been forgiving to me and my family, after i deleted the app... I did get warnings but I'm back on track..."
Duolingo is a great app I learned 15 words in less than 30 minutes! i haven't been able to do Duolingo as much as when I started and Duolingo sends me reminders which help very much. And Duolingo helped me speak to my friends in a whole new language and I was fluent too! this is a great app. This app is very affective which I have tried other apps and none worked but Duolingo sure does.üôÇ
"This app is something to use to learn basic skills in the language you are learning. Those include saying hi, bye, good morning, etc. But, as a person who does not want to pay money, this isn't the best app to learn more than that. I have never tried the paid version of duolingo, so this may not be true for some people. I wish you could learn more, which you can, but I start losing track. Also, I understand where they where going putting the limited hearts in, but I don't really like that."
"It's really good and genuinely helped with my learning. üôÇ Having goals and trying to keep up a streak makes you more determined to practice everyday. ( But like I actually feel so guilty when I don't complete a lesson and it keeps sending me notifications about it üòÅ) It has a lot of languages as well, and the only adds are for super Duolingo, ü¶ú which is like the premium version. I would highly recommend, you've got nothing to lose ( except storage space üòî)"
Duolingo is an excellent language learning platform. I would recommend it to anyone looking to learn the foundation of a second language. The challenges make it easier to stay on track and keep diligent attention to increasing conversational vocabulary. Don't miss too many days or your owl will get sad or he may harass you for slacking. ü¶â üòÇ
"Specifically for learning Japanese and Korean, Duolingo has single-handedly taught me alphabets including hangul, hiragana, and katakana (as well as some kanji which is a new feature) with extreme success. I feel extremely confident writing and reading in other languages thanks to Duolingo. I gave it only 4 stars since the actual vocabulary learning progresses very slowly which makes it hard to advance. the app is great at motivating you but the slow pace takes away from that. Incredible overall"
"I really like the app and the getting used to memorizing the words and sentences. The only the reason I gave it a four was simply because I wish I could learn the language faster, and learn more words in a faster time period. Over all great app and is really nice for people who just want to learn it for fun. It gives really fun lessons, and the pronunciation lessons are really good for people who find it difficult to pronounce words. I really do like this app and think others would too."
"The app is great. But, the heart system is an absolute BS. There have been multiple instances where I'm close to completing a lesson on one heart and then I make one mistake and Bam! I lost all my progress. I do have a solution in mind for this. Instead of loosing 5 hearts over multiple lessons, have a 3 or 4 hearts system for every lesson. If one looses all of their hearts, they'll have to do the lesson all over again. This way, one can fix their mistakes and proceed forward."
Italian practice got bogged on same small handful of questions for several weeks now after an upgrade. Have contacted Duolongo multiple times without response. Also the program does not teach grammar or how to conjugate words. I am finding myself going to Google to find out how sentences are structured how to modify words for various tenses etc.
"This is the most amazing game my child has been loving it. It is so great for teaching. I would highly recommend it. My kid has gotten way better at spanish in like a month or 3 weeks.you get to choose the languageAMAZING! I will say, though, I'm so glad it has no ads now. The bad news is you have to spend diamonds on your lives because every time my kid gets it wrong, it minuses your lives, but you start at 5 lives. Other than that, it is soooo amazing you would love it, but lastly, you pay."
"I'm actually learning Spanish. There's a few things I wish duolingo did, like have a chart of conjunctions and the like. But it's really great and I'm having fun using it. another annoying aspect is the leader boards. I work a very busy job and I wish I could turn that off. I don't need to be reminded I been over taken by someone with far more time than I do."
What is with the sickly looking blob bird. Looks like a pile of vomit and literally grosses me out. Fix it and I'll come back otherwise I'm done with it. Can't stand seeing it every time I open my phone. After reading others reviews it seems developers don't even reply to the issues stated numerous times. Fake ratings are obvious. I'll be trashing this app and looking for something better. It's difficult to navigate and even with volume cranked it's hard to hear the words clearly. Don't buy it.
"OK, listen to me. This IS the best language learning app. I started this for fun (a good reason), and I got hooked. You most likely will as well. Good difficulty progression, but with super duolingo(duo), you may think, ""I don't want to put my card info for a 7 day free trial."" You can do that for a two week trial, but as you go, you can get three days super duo FOR FREE without putting any card info in from chests. Very gamelike, fun, has achievements. DOWNLOAD NOW!"
"4.6.24 ‚Äî I take back everything bad I said about Duolingo. I read in a Duo blog post that the app doesn't teach grammar on purpose. It uses osmosis and repetition, and while I was skeptical, it works. The idea is that children learn this way in their native countries. I gave it a chance and found The Italian course is SO MUCH BETTER. I quit duo a couple years ago because it got so hard I couldn't figure it out. Would still be nice to have a reference sheet though. Back to 5 stars."
"Overall a great app. However, over the last month (February 2024), there has been many instances where the app does not sync, and your lessons don't get counted. It has been very annoying, and if you aren't lucky and have a streak freeze ready, then your constantly wasting your jems just trying to keep your streak afloat. Before this became an issue I would have given 5 stars."
"First off, I find Duolingo is excellent for learning a language. The native speakers are genuine (I'm bilingual so I can tell) and the advanced levels are really well done. Although the repetition may be annoying, it gets those phrases into your long term memory. But the 'game' is glitchy. Many times my 'double points' have just disappeared. Other times it won't let me into certain areas or forgets what I just did. And no it's not my WiFi."
"I adore Duolingo and pay for Super, but a month ago I ran into a level that had a bug which means it cannot be completed. I have submitted bug reports, flagged it, emailed support, and no one has got back to me. It's really interrupted my momentum because I can't progress unless I skip ahead (and I can't stand the idea of that!! haha). I would really like the problem to be fixed, but more importantly it would be nice if someone from the massive empire that is Duolingo actually responded."
"Great app, makes learning super fun and easy. Definitely makes learning a language 1000% better when used side by side with a real curriculum. That being said, it sucks that it doesn't qualify as a language credit. Also, I really wish there was an option to set a few days of the week for a break. Having to still do lessons when you're sick/working/on the weekend kind of sucks. If there were an option to pick a couple of days off that would be awesome."
"I absolutely love Duolingo! It's such a great way to learn a bit everyday in bitesize pieces. However, I'm having trouble turning private mode of as it still thinks I'm under the age of 13. I also think that it would be nice if their was a feature to explain grammar and how it usually works as while it's easy to spot simple patterns, there are some areas which are more confusing."
"The quality of translations has gone way down since getting rid of most human translators and turning it over to AI. I can't tell you the number of times it's said a correct answer was wrong, and I send flags each time. For example, ""ni√±a"" & ""chica"" both mean girl, so it isn't *wrong* to use one over the other. I've also had times their translation was flat out wrong. That's not to mention the number of times the mic doesn't pic up speech, or the times it crashes/freezes up."
"The countdown on the rapid lessons is rediculous! I can't possibly type that fast, as well as it being a language that isn't native to my keyboard so typos and corrections occur. Yet the timer keeps ticking :( other than that I'm loving it so far, besides the excess of ads, that is. Which I suppose is to be expected. However, if the price were a bit more reasonable I would have no bothers paying for super, even if just to remove the ads, which I imagine will drive me away relatively soon."
"Excellent app overall. Four things: - great for vocabulary and pronunciation but not for grammar, as there are no explanation why I get it wrong (languages have rules, if they're not explained, you learn by repetition, with no understanding of the language structure) - the quality of the recordings is sub-standard which can make listening a challenge, even with headphones. - Some of the teachings are incorrect - some adverts lag and force me to close the app and reopen it."
"Not a bad service, good motivation for language-learning, IN GENERAL really good. When I do a timed lesson, if the lesson times out before I finish, the app freezes on a grayed out screen. I have to close the app and restart it. This is really frustrating. Sometimes, when I'm really motivated to continue, I open the wrong app accidentally. Please fix this."
"Resuming: the best app to learn languages. Just two things: first, let's keep avoiding ads and talking about ""becoming pro"". And second, instead of making too many lessons on the same content, it would be best if having, let's say, around five or six lessons for each content, and teach new words a bit faster, and, to be systematic, add whole ""review"" units across courses. Of course, with less lessons, let's say, around three, four, or maybe, even five. But not so many. Speak to type not working."
"Fun and easy interface, but unfortunately, it focuses mostly on parroting phrases rather than teaching and explaining the mechanics of the language. No explanations if you're confused about how or why certain words are used. No explanations of grammer and tenses and such. As such, you'll learn to say things, but you won't very easily learn how to build and independently use the language. It's fun, but if you're really serious about learning a language well and quickly, there are better options."
"Good but some futures are limiting, like the hearts as it just makes it harder to learn if you punish mistakes. Also the demotion zone upsets people if they lose something they worked hard for. Imagine losing something like that that you even worked on holidays for, when you are ill, when you've had no sleep, it's just too much sometimes. It is an amazing app though if you want to learn new languages with lots of different techniques to help. I like all the characters too."
"(Spanish Course) does a great job of teaching a language by breaking it down into smaller sections to work on. a few downsides. 1) after a few chapters the app tends to crash often and doesn't load the animations. 2) it tends to freeze in the middle of a lesson but an easy fix for it is long press the icon, app info, force stop. 3) the lessons teach you new words and conjugation for them, but then later goes in depth about patterns to look for. overall a good app, I plan to keep using it."
"A great ""free"" way to learn or brush up on a language. The ads are not too disruptive, but with very few mistakes you are forced to buy back in or delay your lesson; a more generous algorithm might be more conducive to encourage usage and learning...but then I guess they would like you to buy in for unlimited play. It's probably worth it if you can skip lessons as it sometimes feels it progresses slowly. I recommend playing without noise or distractions to prevent mistakes."
I have been using duolingo for over several years. The app is one of the best for learning languages. But it is missing a very crucial feature. The ability to reset an entire unit or one of the circles inside a unit. If you are far into the curriculum you often forget which units/circles you need repeat because you haven't learned or undertsood them or just for revision. I'm sure many other people would find this feature helpful. Kudos to you for this free and fun language learning app. üëè
"I've been using the app for 2 years. The paid version, Super Duolingo, is far worse than the free product. It doesn't make any sense to design pay-to-win features in an app that is supposed to be educational. Because if you pay to win a language test you're literally paying not to learn. On top of this basic flaw, the system running the ads is very buggy, especially since the last update. The app will crash at least once a day when trying to run ads. The ads themselves are often for scam apps."
"Edit: I love the app and I pay for it. The reminders are not as passive aggressive anymore. Two big downsides: 1. Kanji, please teach them from the start! The seperate tab is way too slow and is not consistent with stroke order. 2. The sections and units keep shifting and changing in Japanese. It doesn't feel like I am making progress, because I get thrown back and forth between units with updates. The paths inside each unit are way too long, I get the hang of it in two lessons."
"Very good learning app. It has helped a lot. There are a few bugs where my answers were coded as wrong but the correction displayed the same answer I gave as correct. Also when there are more than one word for an item, I got it wrong when I used the first one learned even though they're the same meaning. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoy using this app!"
"I was having a great time, but I think Match Madness is terribly broken. It is impossible to get much past level 5 without buying time extensions or cheating (the match order is predictable!) You are then stuck getting 5-10xp and can't start over at level 1 unless it asks you. It's not fun, and doesn't help me learn. I'd also like to see a list of the words and phrases I have seen and be able to run though unit and section reviews. Edit: They added the ability to see a list of words, and a star"
"It used to be an amazing app, but since they removed the option to discuss sentences with other users, I've noticed that my learning pace has significantly slowed down. I gained so much insight from other people's explanations, and now it feels like I'm just memorizing sentences without truly understanding the grammar or vocabulary choices. Sometimes I try to look things up online, but it's frustrating compared to the convenience of having it just a click away like before."
"I've been using this app for a few years (Super Duo family plan) and overall it's a great way to learn. My only complaint is that in recent months, I've noticed that the daily quests screen is slow to update. I've almost lost my streak when a quick peek at that screen shows I've already gotten 30 XP that day, only for it to suddenly change to 0 XP several seconds later, right before my eyes - because it was initially showing yesterday's info. Sometimes I can't tell if I've done a lesson or not."
"Fantastic app. It's fun and addictive in the right ways, and has helped me get interested in learning again. However, the ads are a problem. I know the app needs ads to run, but I wear headphones (as the app recommends) to better hear the sounds, and then after each lesson has a VERY loud ad plays right in my ear, which is both annoying and hurts. Perhaps playing ads on half volume or mute as a default could be implemented?"
"It's a good language app and I feel that I'm making good progress. The speech/sound is clear and will understandable and the topics are useful. What is like to see if better tailoring to the users needs - maybe have some options to choose goals (e.g. vocabulary, pronunciation, grammar, etc). For example, the personalized practice keeps showing me from the same set of sentences from session to session, even when my answers are correct several times in a row."
"The app has been helpful in smoothing out my chosen language. However, the hearts system is horrible. It's discouraging at best. Especially if you're doing a longer session on the app in the higher tiers of the courses. Also, reviewing your mistakes is behind a paywall. Of all things to put behind a paywall in an education app, this should never be one. Loses a star for this alone."
"I enjoy learning a new language. Duolingo is easy to use. An improvement would be to only collect badges and not compete in the league. That's not motivating for me, grades aren't real but progress is measureable. Choosing your level of interest and proficiency goals would also be helpful. Is this available in the paying app? The app occasionally doesn't give me my progress when I get 100%, that's annoying.ü§ì I don't want to compete with others learning a language. Progress only, please."
"Im having such a good time on this app. It's both educational and fun. ( as someone who gets bored pretty easily, so this especially helps). It's also colourful and interactive. It helps you set goals for yourself and encourages you to keep going. Also, the adds aren't really a problem. They ( adds) usually come in after every level has been completed and it doesn't take away from the learning experience at all. 10/10 would recommend üòä"
"The comments section really helped a lot, it's a shame you removed it Also audio keeps missing from my lessons. It appears at times, and I hear the sounds of notification (right and wrong answers, lesson end), but I'd like to hear some pronunciation as well. All in all - fun app, encouraging you to continue your language studies, but be sure to use it alongside other materials"
"I like the app. However, when I play consistently, it becomes too demanding to complete all the daily tasks when the algorithm does not allow me to fulfill them all unless I complete so many lessons. I think this is unreasonable and discourages me from being interested in playing as much. It also makes the user experience less fun. I could skip a day, use a freeze, and reset the algorithm to set easier daily tasks. But this contrasts a true spree and creates gaps between lessons."
"I enjoy the challenges, different lesson styles. However, what Duolingo lacks is actual explanations of grammatical rules and sentence structure, for instance. The lesson overview is largely unhelpful and bare. If someone were to start a new concept/conjugation they should be able to learn about it and not just guess the correct answer based on context in hopes of getting it right. I think it would be helpful to include a ""why"" at the bottom after an incorrect answer is submitted if it applies."
"Lots of bugs in interface where messages doesn't allow user to progress, (no button or hidden) (message overlaying choices) only option to quit. Need to clean up the interface guys. I'm currently learning Japanese, the voices sound a little unnatural. The principles are good. The learning curve is good. Just frustrating when you hit a bug."
"The lessons start easy and become harder, building off what was previously learned. There is a lot of repetition to ensure that even if you happen to ""guess"" correctly the first time you actually learn the words and how to properly use them. The lessons center around a particular topic so you get that word repetition quickly, then move on to a different topic. There is a good mix of reading, listening and speaking to ensure you are learning all aspects of the language."
"You need to know American English. i.e. ""downtown"" and missing out ""of"" and ""that"" . They never accept Football, only soccer I dislike clicking to the next ""page"" and the audio starting in a nano second . i would prefer to click to start it. However; the whole site is put together spectacularly well and is a fabulous learning tool. It can be totally free, which is amazing. i have chosen to pay for ""super duo"". if you can afford it, it's worth every penny. Happy learning."
"You will learn another language eventually. The repetition is great for committing new concepts to memory. It could use more adjectives and synonyms to help you to establish a style of communicating, however. You're on your own there. You also won't learn much if you don't make sure to refrain from looking at the optional answers altogether until you've thought of the entire sentence on your own. It's necessarily too easy for the most part, unless you follow your own rules of navigation."
"Great app for learning language! it is very thorough and it goes over sentences over and over to make sure you remeber and understand them. the only issue is that when the ""five in a row!"" and similar screens pop up, on semi-old phones the animation is really laggy and will take around 2 seconds to get back to the lesson, sometimes making you unable to even see the ""five in a row"" animation and instead show a white screen for 2 seconds. overall though, great app! üòá"
"Its great so far, but then you get stuck with a burst of new terms, with really no way to practice them. When you have a paid service, there is a training area, but it does not allow you to choose the lession type you want to practice. such as all/current/last 3. A lot of the time I get stuck on the same exercise for the entire day. Also for some reason there is no addition of note cards to or a way to choose to make your own test. That said, great second or third tool to use to learn."
"Duolingo is an easy way to learn a new language. I think that this application could be improved by having personalised lessons to strengthen your weak parts in the language. Also, I think this app should have a 'What have you learnt?' challenge, where, at the end of each level, you answer the questions based on the level you have just finished. The language I am learning doesn't include speaking exercises or stories, which is a bit disappointing."
"The quests system is very bugged. Sometimes I will complete a daily quest, but I won't get the reward nor a point towards completion for the goals for the month. Sometimes it will randomly update later in the day, but usually not. This has been an issue for months. For some reason I also need to meet 50 quests a month, whereas my friends only need 30. Not sure if its because my XP is higher, but I feel like it should be the same for everyone. I do have Duolingo super, but I won't renew as of now"
"It's a great app for your kids of you want them to improve reading. Great app duolingo! Keep up the great work. Overall assessment: While Duolingo isn't a perfect app, it is one of the best ones out there for learning a language because it's flexible for both the casual, and the intensive, language learner. It is a fun way to get students to learn new languages and improve their vocabulary in a fun and interactive way. Overall I just love this app.I have no words but excellent fantastic app.‚≠êüí´‚ö°"
"This app really helps you learn a language, or if you already know a little of the language, you can practice more on what you already know. Btw, as a person with a busy life, the exp challenges that you do to rank up are really like if you have Super Duolingo, you're set to get the top three. I was racing somebody with super, and they got 200 exp in 10 minutes. I only got 30. It's pay to win."
They've suddenly become more interested in making money and making poor decisions. They greatly increased the event difficulty several magnitudes beyond what it was so it's no longer useful. I keep getting content in practice mode that I haven't even gone over yet. I often accidentally hit the can't listen now. I would like the ability to at least have to confirm or cancel that out. Maybe even move it somewhere else.
"After 85 days, I've removed some stars. My main issues: Sentences are oddly structured. I would never say or need half of the sentences taught, especially when traveling for a few weeks. Even the sentences in my native tongue are awkward and clunky. Their outlines before each section don't always help and often the lessons aren't related to them. Only bumped it from 2 to 3 stars because it can be used for free. I'll stick to Rosetta Stone where I've been able to use and retain more."
"I love Duolingo, but the app is glitchy and causes unnecessary frustration. For example, if you finish a lesson at midnight it clears all your daily goals with no chests to open, or on the ramp up XP challenge it will randomly make me start at the beginning, even though I made it with time left. I wish it had more options to keep me involved, love the matching game, but it isn't always available in Japanese or other languages. Also miss stories. Wish all languages had these options."
"Errors in lessons are no longer being corrected in a timely manner. I've reported a couple that I'm 100% certain are wrong, but they continue to show up. I'm not sure if it's months later, but definitely weeks later. It's still useful at this point, but if something looks questionable, don't assume it's right. Update: I've discovered that listening to the intonation in Duolingo is interfering with learning to speak correctly."
"I have a weak knowledge of Spanish, and have wanted to improve. I have completed just a few lessons so far, and they are great. I especially appreciate that the app can test speaking skills through use of the phone microphone. Weeks later: Overall still great. Sometimes seems to get ""stuck"" and will not open until I reboot my phone (Pixel 6, Android 14)."
"Decent. However I cannot give it 5 stars because of its lack of accessibility in crucial places. For example, I can just barely complete the matching exercises, because the app requires me to turn off my screen reader. Guess how useful that is to someone who can't see. , it's super frustrating, especially when I am made to repete the exercise for getting it wrong. I understand the app doesn‚Äôt understand how unhelpful that is, But if any of you devs out there see this, please, if you care at all"
"I think this app would be better if there was a more clear overview of what you are learning. The new path system leaves me feeling lost, especially since half the lessons in the current section dont have anything to do with the section. Not to mention the new ""course refresher"" lessons create a ton of friction when trying to come back from breaking a streak. Maybe if I devoted more time to Duo, but I was under the impression this was supposed to be incremental and that's what I liked."
"I've used Duolingo since 2013, lots of changes over the years but I have no major complaints. I've gained a decent grasp of three languages, two more in the works, all totally free and that's really cool. One thing I would REALLY like to see is an option during those basic prompts to say the translation of a sentence rather than having to search for the words and tap on them. It would save a bit of time, feel more natural, and give you more speech practice."
"So I came back to Duo after a year or 2 and yes I missed the app. However some things have changed. Before I could retake the legendary classes without paying gems but now I can't. Also, Duo just always happens to drop my connection after a class, especially once I get a 2x boost. I'd have to close and reopen the app just to take the next class and that's not optimal. Still though, great work guys! This is my favorite app for learning any language"
"It definitely is not the same as taking classes to learn a language, but it can help at the beginning. It has a ""repetition makes perfect"" approach. However, it really lacks emphasis on grammar rules. Also, it would be really beneficial if there was an option to choose between the Latin American and the Spanish accent on the Spanish course (mind it is a very widespread language) because now I am stuck with the former pronunciation and vocabulary when I'd rather learn the latter."
"Great app, not fond of the forced competitions. The leaderboards and reminders of my spot on the leaderboards makes me want to stop using it entirely. I wish that feature could be turned off. I'm learning for me, not for a scoreboard. I have been paying for premium and dont know if I will continue to. I'm glad it provides the knowledge it does for so many people though. (Edit as of 2024) I'm really happy to see the leader boards became more of an optional feature! 5 stars."
"I have been using Duolingo for Spanish since 2022. It was great and very easy to learn until the ads started showing up one day. Without the super subscription, it's just too hard to keep practicing for a long time. I was forced to take a subscription and it was really helpful. But over the last few months, I have been facing a lot of bugs and glitches that are making me furious The lessons don't register in the friend's quest and XP boost sometimes vanishes. I hope the team fixes it!"
"The progression is steady & feels easy. Mistakes are reviewed in the lesson and lessons are generated to help correct previous mistakes in the icon errors. New vocabulary is introduced in very small batches within the topic. I love the fact that we have Freezes, it helps especially if we have to travel or too ill to do any lesson to keep our streak. I really feel like I'm learning without effort, the free version is very good but the paying option has more options. I highly recommend Duolingo."
"It is an educational way to waste time but not for serious language learning. The biggest annoyances for me are the mistakes. It has the option to report them, but it is a waste of time as they never get fixed. It really is shocking how many grammatical errors I have found in the English translations of phrases. It tells me I am wrong and gives me a version of the sentence that is grammatically incorrect. Next time it pops up it's more of a quiz on what Duo thinks the answer is."
"Started out with it and it was fine, but after a while it got to a point where I just don't want to engage with the app anymore. It does have genuine language learning, which is why 2 stars instead of 1, but it feels like proper learning is devalued. Instead of understanding the language, I'm taught to memorize individual translations, and more emphasis than I'm happy with is placed on maintaining daily streaks and competing for rank. Will be seeking a more effective alternative going forward."
It's definitely not worth the $155+ annual subscription cost. I sincerely hope no one is paying that. It isn't even worth the 60% off rate. The app developers have gone mad. There are so many bugs. And ads are now after every single lesson and getting longer. It used to be one ad every 2-4 lessons. The new interface is awful and reset progress for tons of users. Also the quests do not update correctly and you'll frequently not get credit for completing them.
"It is nice to learn, but it has its cons. It keeps spamming me with super doulingo ads, and it says that I can get it for free, and one second later it asks me to buy it for what, 12 dollars? Also, it is laggy, and it has streak-saving problems. I did a lesson, and it tells me that I didn't, even though I did, leading to my streak being lost. I wish that you could add more widget themes and types. I sometimes enter the lesson, and when I use a more formal version of the word, WRONG! üëé"
I actually love the app and even wanted to upgrade to premium a month at a time as I can't really afford to drop $80 right now. Had a hard time finding where to do that without directly clicking an ad. Found a button that says renew subscription. I click it expecting a menu with payment options. Instead it automatically charges my account for $83 when I have never had that subscription before (not the whole year). How are they allowed to do that??
"I've tried some other language learning apps but Duolingo is definitely the best one so far, it's fun, interactive and easy to use. I mean, really easy, my 8 year old sister knows how to use it- it's AWESOME It would've been 5 stars but I've come across a little issue. Other language learning apps I've used have this thing where you must say the word out loud, into your microphone, and helps with pronunciation. Duo doesn't have that but I'd change my rating to 5 stars if it could be put in!!!!!"
"This review is for the paid service. The big warning I would give is that customer service for this app is non-existent - I've emailed questions about my subscription multiple times and no response, which is pretty poor considering how much it costs! Also, in the Italian course the content of the units seems to have suddenly changed and become far easier (going from complex tenses to colours, for example. I wouldn't have paid for a course that was so basic, so I feel like I've been cheated!"
"Longer I use this app the less I like it. My Japanese lessons progress has been rolled back so many times, and it's just frustrating to have really non-sensical sentences as examples. Over the years, they have removed more features than added. There used to be a community that helped to explain grammar and other questions, but they REMOVED IT. And with the news of layoffs and replacing their workers with AI... yeah, I don't feel comfortable supporting this app. The owl was cute, though."
"I like DuoLingo, but the free version is terribly limited. For example, you need the Super subscription to be able to review your mistakes and correct them, which is an important part of learning a language. Also, everything requires gems in the free version, again limiting your ability to learn any language consistently. The only way is forward without reviewing past lessons if you're low on gems. I'm glad they sometimes offer 2-week trials, but they've really gotta improve the free version."
"Every day, starting approximately a month ago, my progress in the app is being ‚Äúsynced‚Äú with new or some other content, blah blah... This ‚Äúsyncing‚Äú actually means that my progress is being thrown back to a previous unit. In other words, every new day I have a Groundhog Day. It's a terrible experience. And I've already reported a bug about this. No more stars until this is resolved."
"The graphics make language learning fun! However, since I have been doing 4 languages, in the words section, the app confuses German words with Spanish ones. Also, the audio is really glitchy, most times not able to be heard at all on the section matching the sounds with the print. The only option is to say I can't do listening right now....because I can't hear anything!!! This is a new segment, and I hope it gets improved soon."
"This app uses sentences that wouldn't be used in everyday conversation. Ex. ""Can you go out tonight?"" "" No, I can't because my dog wants to go to the restaurant."" ü§® They used to have a forum where you can communicate with other speakers about the structure of sentences, tenses, and much more. The more experienced speakers would help the beginners but they closed that permanently. The basics (Numbers, days of the week) pop up in matching games randomly instead of whole lessons."
"I was really enjoying the app until it decided to ""sync my progress with the new and improved Chinese course."" It now thinks I've learnt a lot of words and grammar that I've never seen before. I can only review lessons I've never seen before. It has wiped all my previous mistakes so I can't practice things I was struggling with. I can't do new lessons because I no longer have the correct foundation. There was no notification that it was going to do this. Really disappointed."
"I love this app. It makes learning a new language so fun! I'd like some more detailed grammar related explanations though. Sometimes it's hard to understand why something is counted as an error, when nothing is ever explained. The only real issue I have with this app, is that it freezes pretty often, when I do more than just a few levels at once. Still love it though and the Owl widget is the cherry on top!"
"A few updates ago, they made everything work, then they updated it a few more times and trashed it. There are now too many problems to list (including on a new phone). In addition to app issues, the problems include a decline in actual course quality. I used to recommend Duo to everyone, but now I am embarrassed that I did and steer people away from it. At this point, I emphasise DO NOT pay for it. If you want to use it for some basics or to brush up, it's ok, but don't trust it fully."
"Lots of repetition, great way to learn a language. Everything explained really well. Several years later, the endless repetition is very boring, the English idioms are American ones, there are virtually no new words, no more instruction on grammar or tenses. A couple of weeks ago, despite practising every day, it said I'd skipped a day and used a streak freeze. In the last 24 hours, it started telling me I'm offline (I'm not), and returned me to day one! That's the last straw - I quit."
"I've only been doing it for a few days, but I have already found it incredibly enjoyable. I do think that (as a suggestion) that there could be better ways of remembering the hirigana. For example, in school, I was taught 'ka' as car off a cliff because it made it easier to remember. Just an idea. Overall, good app. Edit: It's really annoying! I did my lesson yesterday and the day before that and yet it used up a streak freeze, saying I hadn't done my lesson! Really frustrating! Please fix it!"
"User beware! I used it and tried the free trial of Super Duolingo. It definitely has advantages over the non-subscription base, like unlimited messups. It reminded me trial period would be over in 2 days, so I changed the subscription in app so it would cancel. Well, it didn't and in 2 days I was getting billed the $89 for a year subscription (no refunds). Not happen Apparently you have to cancel it in the Google Play Store. Overall, it's a decent app and it helped learn the language some."
"It was an amazing language app!! One can learn languages as long as they stay consistent with their progress and adapt them through the things they also have fun doing, like studying and listening to music with the language you want to learn, then after, search for the meanings of the lyrics. I hope there would also be additional languages by this year like Bengali, Thai and many more. Thank you!!"
"Duolingo is the perfect app to learn a language or to learn several languages. I really enjoy the logical progression through the lessons and the ability to review and re-review harder lessons. I deducted a star because the one aspect of the app I don't enjoy is the competitiveness. It is great you can interact with other users, but like any other app with a social component, you have the people who simply abuse it to the detriment of others and ruin the overall experience."
"It's a great app overall, but it would be nice to be able reference past lessons without having to complete them again. Plus the speaking parts can be a little glitchy - I sneezed during one and passed, and in another, I had my whole family say the word ""l'oeuf"" and none of us got it correct. I can't find a ""report problems"" feature, either."
"Considering this program is free, it is really excellent, a genuine example of something for nothing. For me, the only other program or software comparable would be Gmail. Duolingo is that useful. As an English teacher, I suggest this is very good for vocabulary building, basic grammar, so reading and to some extent listening. Speaking OK too, writing only from a higher level of knowledge."
"It's awesome how much you get for free with Duolingo. I personally have no problem with the number of ads in the free version. For my goals, I don't need to have unlimited hearts. The Duolingo team has changed things up several times, and there are things that I miss about previous iterations. For instance, now you are forced into a specific learning path sequence, which eliminates a lot of the ability to choose what to learn about. Even with that, I'm very happy with this app."
"Update 2024 please fix the random crashing during a lesson. Just crashes and won't restart. - The perfect app for learning and practicing written and reading skills in other languages. The user interface is excellent and intuitive, with friendly reminders to practice. I think the app and the Duolingo system has been done very well and I would consider going Pro if I were more disciplined about practicing! Highly recommended, I have done some lessons in a few languages and it is very consistent."
"Take away the hearts. The app makes it more about hearts than the learning experience. The lives force you to focus on making little to no mistakes. People shouldn't get dinged for making mistakes when thats how you learn. The leader board sucks too. Take it away. The app becomes more about competition/ getting 1st place than learning. The refresher courses dont make sense. It seems that they are too basic even when you are far past that. I don't want to learn ""agua"" again when I'm past that."
"I really enjoyed the app, but multiple times, they will go through and completely overhaul your course changing things around. They'll add words and phrases into previous units you've already completed saying that you've learned it, but you haven't. It's really frustrating. It kills any passion and momentum you have learning. Also, despite the pictures they show, I have never once gotten a speaking lesson."
"Why can I still not access the new music lessons that we were told about last year? I like your app and have used it for years to learn a language, but I was excited to try the music lessons. I've waited patiently, but they never show on my app. I've tried updating and googling solutions. Nothing has worked. I'm very disappointed that it's not accessible. I'd rate your app higher if I could access the music and math that I was told about months ago. This would be a '5' if not for this."
I really like this app. But it's annoying that comments have been disabled and you're not allowed to make more than five mistakes in the free version wich I know is supposed to be motivating but sometimes it's really frustrating. Making mistakes is a major part of learning and shouldn't stop one from doing so. Also you can only get the correct awnser with one sentence structure when there's multiple to use in real life. So I almost always have to guess what the app wants me to say.
"Duolingo is an excellent and fun way to practice and learn a language. It's sometimes repetitive, but that's a necessary part of the learning process, or you easily forget. At a free level, making silly or accidental mistakes can be really frustrating, ending your day's progress (no more credits), but you can still practice without advancing. I find the format mostly clear, useful and amusing. I'm improving my French, even after living in France for seven years. It's giving me a lot."
"I'm on a 1300+ day streak with Duolingo and what it's offered has been well put together in terms of lesson content. But the app itself is often so glitchy that it's unusable. Crashes frequently sometimes crashing my whole phone with it. Sometimes the keyboard won't come up, sometimes it won't go away. Has got worse recently to the point I'm on the verge of giving up. Such a shame."
"Over the last several months, Duolingo's lesson structure has fallen off big time. I'm using this everyday over the last two years and more, and I still see the same sentences that I saw over a year ago, although I have done 100s of lessons since. No new learning material, it just says 'personalized practice' as the topic of every lesson, and it's basically just redundant words and sentences. What happened? Product team needs to wake up. ML models are good, but have some supervison please"
"Yeah... This is definitely the best language app out there. The response time of the app. The content. The gameification. The ability to enjoy practicing for a long time. The reuse of the same words for new sentences, so it's all familiar, but distinctly a new meaning! A+ on that point. The option to use the keyboard or tap words, to increase difficulty on yourself. Definitely the best language app out there. And I've tried nearly all the apps for the language I'm learning."
"I'm giving you 2 stars because while the app is good, you have a few glaring and outright annoying issues. 1. No patch notes. A little blurb that's says ""we changed"" is unacceptable when every program posts patch notes. 2. Moving me in the program when you update. Now, there are multiple words I don't know that I'm being questioned on and no way of checking. 3. When I turn off a setting, leave it off - pronunciation. I know what I clicked. I'll change the score if and when you address this."
I've paid for this app for two years. I've become more confident in speaking Spanish but it's a far from perfect means of learning. It seems to concentrate more on league tables and streaks and its use of the language is very inconsistent. Some of the voices are incomprehensible. It's now stopped working. All attempts to contact Duolingo have failed. They don't respond to any means of communication at all. I have only just renewed my subscription and feel I've been cheated.
"Duolingo has really gone downhill recently. Yesterday was just the latest of several incidents where I gained a significant number of xp points, only to find myself knocked back down to where I had been prior. I had 84 xp yesterday morning and earned another 80 last night for a total of 164xp. However, this morning, I was back down to 84xp. This is very disappointing, especially for a paid subscription. I see from the comments that I am not the only one experiencing this. Please fix this issue."
"It's adequate. I gave the free trial a shot, and was going to probably subscribe soon, but I have noticed that the lessons were all easy enough during the Super, but as soon as you aren't paying and you're limited on how many mistakes you can make without paying for premium, it starts throwing things at you to make sure you fail, to ensure you have plenty of incentives to give them money. And of course the 'practice your mistakes' mode is not a free feature. Pretty scummy tactics."
"I was learning chinese over 2 years ago and recently picked it back up with the app, the older version when I was learning had basic speaking exercises to help get you to use the correct tones which I really liked! I come back recently and find that feature is gone unless you pay for it, I was going to pay for it when I realised it was going to charge me more then I pay for netflix or any of my streaming services! I tried the free trial and I can't even access the speaking parts still!"
"Good language resource but the ads are constant and repetitive. It's clearly done on purpose to annoy you and force into buying premium. The whole app is set up that way, including punishing users for making mistakes with the heart system, which is ridiculous considering how difficult it can be to learn a new language. I'm starting to lose interest and will look elsewhere to learn."
"Although the grammar explanations are poor, the layout of the curriculum is not bad. I like the fact that you can study multiple languages at once. The daily reminders and encouragements also help me remember to do it everyday. I'm a casual learner with experience learning another language before, so my goal is to do 5 minutes a day and improve gradually. For people in a hurry or with a concrete goal, the paid version that gives you more control over reviewing mistakes might be a good investment"
"(please read to the end developers). This has to be the best language app. I've had a very good learning experience using this app. My favorite aspect is the friend quests, I'm always excited to complete them and they really help me progress. Although I wish a feature where we learners can chat with and practice using texts with those on our friend list could be added. Thanks for a great app.üòä"
"Horrible Changes! This was a great app and I have been using it for over a year. The latest update has taken a lot of the fun out of it. I don't enjoy it anymore & most days i don't even want to open the app. The new layout is unfriendly an makes it seem like a chore. New update: Constant app lags. Does not register my data at the cost of falling behind in leagues and having to pay diamonds for streak freezes even when I am active! Happens frequently! Many unnecessary changes, all for the worse."
This app has a very nice UI and the humourous way of encouraging everyone to learn languages through streaks is amazing. It's a nice app but I really want to learn Sanskrit through Duolingo. I think it can help many Indian students. The Sanskrit vocabulary and grammer is something that is not an easy task for some Indian students to master it perfectly. Your company says that you also promote languages that may extinct. So it would be nice if you promote Sanskrit aswell. it is now spoken rarely
"This is a great app, as I have said before. But I feel like there is an issue that is small bit, which makes me lose my motivation to do my lessons. This is the fact of the leaderboards. These were really fun until lots of people got duolingo Plus. Now it's almost impossible to get anywhere in higher leagues, and you constantly move down if you don't have duo plus. A simple solution would be to create 2 leagues. One for people with duo plus and another for those who don't have it."
"A good app, but I have concerns about the direction of the program. Duolingo has removed its best features. I can no longer ask other people about a weird phrase and know why I was wrong. I can no longer go out to Duo's language events. I can no longer expect updates for small languages or expect any new courses. My best most immersive language learning experiences via this app (and accompanying website) are now impossible. Now Duolingo is the same as every other app. For beginners only."
"Works perfectly well in the UK and Europe. I tried to use it whilst in China and it kept telling me that I needed to add a telephone number... problem was, it insisted the number had to start +86. In other words, this app completely fails as a language app if you take it to China."
"I'm actually doing lessons which is the point but it's freezing up still 3.18.24 for the last 45mins it isn't being added to my total. I even just uninstalled and reinstalled Dulingo hoping that It freezes often when I'm trying to do a lesson or practice lesson and doesn't let me continue. I have to go in and out of the app hoping it will work, but it doesn't always unfreeze. I came here to check if there is an update or if needs one and there isn't one. It's a wonderful tool otherwise. 12.8.23"
"Cool app if you want to repeat sentences instead of learning the actual rules of a language. I feel like the curriculum should include the rules of the language as it goes on, but the only help it offers is a small button in the corner with maybe 3 examples. May or may not even be what you're looking for. Repeating the same 5 sentences every day is causing problems in my progress with this app, and I only open it to do a practice lesson for my streak."
Love the gamified experience. So addictive and fun. But I would have wanted them to include more relevant exampls and also there is a lot of repetition which is good because the vocabulary sticks but at the same time makes it boring. Also add the opportunity to create sentences from scratch
"Great app for learning, intuitive and user-friendly too. You guys are the best, really. I do have a problem though, when I started out, XP lightning challenge used to be available for Spanish (for my account) during the week but all of a sudden it got changed to Match madness. I enjoy the former challenge better for certain reasons and I don't know if there's a way to revert/undo the change. I've had to start learning a different language because of this change. I wish it could be changed."
"The basic idea initially seemed very promising, could have been perfect. But regrettably the infinite patience of the machine is driven to an extreme, resulting in an incredibly slow learning pace. The same handful of sentences are repeated over and over with very little, if any, new material introduced. As if the over all goal is too keep the learner stuck with the application as long as possible. That was really not what I expected when I enrolled."
"It used to be so good but they keep removing features: no community input on exercises, no grammar explanations and now I can't choose to type out answers instead of using the word bank. I know duo is an app but in my opinion it's too game like and needs to be more challenging. Instead of introducing new topics all the time, new grammar more often would be appreciated, maybe with a challenge option. One update I have enjoyed is that there are longer listening and reading tasks now."
Well there are no ads since I'm using this app ...the thing i love about this the most Also with practice I'm gaining confidence as well that I can learn language very well...This app even feel like a friend who reminds you to study and practice hard lol !! The best app ever...go for it But the thing I don't get it whenever I try to learn Thai language it always ask for changing the phone language system why is that ?? Can't we learn Thai with the help of English...please check this issue out.
Great way to learn a new language only thing that I struggle with is I can't find the reason something is spelled or said that way. For example in Italian there are different ways to say the la il and so on but I don't know how to differentiate which is which. But other than that it's amazing alot of fun activities and practices and worth the premium payments as well.
"I get that it costs money to keep the app running but they excessively keep advertising the super version, which is annoying because in order to do most of the activities that give you more XP you need to pay for the super version. It's like rubbing it in your face that you could be rid of the annoying limitations on mistakes and needing gems for everything. I'm definitely not gonna pay for the super version if you keep reminding me of it after every lesson."
"Still 'syncing my work'. If this is an attempt to force me to upgrade to the paid version, its not working but it's getting ridiculous. 25.2.24 - I don't know what happened but I can't progress at all in the last three weeks. I keep getting a message that Duolingo synced my progress to a new and improved content, however I'm repeating the same lessons over and over because it won't stop 'sync' my work. I've been using Duolingo for over 2.5 years and have never been more frustrated with the app."
"The ads are invasive. If I were going to pay for an app that taught Spanish, it certainly wouldn't be duolingo. Unless the devs restructure duolingo to provide a more concise and in-depth language app, it should remain free. The more invasive the ads, the more likely I will consider switching to a better language app like babbel."
"I've tried Rosetta stone, babel, and some other lesser known German learning programs but duolingo is the only one that I find really helps me retain the Information. the structure of learning helps you pick apart sentences and learn quickly plus the setup they have allows you to feel like you are being awarded every time you complete something (especially if you do well) this really helps you stick with it. I'm at 130 days now and see no reason to stop!"
"Duolingo free version is not a good experience. However, getting the paid version (discounted) was a pretty good deal. I use this in combination with Mango Languages through my local library, which has been the best experience I've found after trying other apps over the years. Duo has a few things that bug me, but overall I think it does pretty well with content, accuracy, and accessibility approaching a new language. It's a pretty good value for something I use every day."
"this app is so glitchy that frankly I can't trust anything I've learned from it. not to mention half of my progress gets lost to these glitches. and now i cant even progress at ALL because of them. I'm done trying to make this app work, it's absolutely not worth the frustration. it was glitchy & unreliable when it first came out & now it's even worse than ever."
"Not impressed. There's a lot of repetition, which is good, but it will randomly throw in new words and expect you to know them. It will also speak the words w/o seeing how they are spelled and have you try to match them to the English translation through multiple choice. At that point it becomes a guessing game and frustrating. There's also no explaination on how sentences, words or sounds are formed in the language you're learning. Not sure how anyone can learn a new language from this."
"I personally think that Duolingo is such a nice and easy way to learn a new language, BUT I do wish they had a way they could teach English. I have friends that don't speak fluent english, and it's kinda hard to learn their language It would be great if that was added, but other than that, I think Duolingo deserves a 4/5. It's really good, and I recommend it."
"There's quite a bit I didn't love about this app, but didn't break the experience for me. What DID break it was the recent update that totally messed up the order and content of the lessons. Like other users, I now have many words that I'm supposed to have learnt, but didn't. Didn't find it worth the price before this (AI, no grammar support etc), and recent changes only solidify this."
"Duolingo is an amazing app. I hate that full minute adds follow up getting a 15 minute timed buff if you want extra gems, instead of the normal 5-10 second ones, but I plan on upgrading once the AI chat is available on Android (or I bother getting an iOS emulator set up), so I can gut to the ad issues until then."
"This app used to be better until they updated it a little while ago. I don't feel like I'm learning and retaining words anymore. Everything is multiple choice or put the words in order. I don't actually have to generate the words so while I can recognize them, I haven't fully learned them. They also took away the comment section which was very helpful and now you are left to try to figure things out on your own."
"After all, Duolingo is a great app for people who want to learn languages for free. It was good at start but when I decided to also do it on my computer then the phone app wouldn't open but overall it was a good language app. I also get lowered down leagues which then pressurises me and I'm in a high league that I don't want to get lowered so there should be a leave option for it."
"A humble opinion of an experienced learner of multiple languages and a teacher of English as a foregn language: I grasped this app, after a long break since I used it before, hoping that it would give me finally some good learner-experience. I could not be more wrong... Around Unit 23-24 (learning Italian based on English) the new content presented has become so randomised, a few translations for one word, or even a few words translated interchangeably into a few others... And the hearts..."
"Unfortunately, the developers have decided to not allow photo avatars any longer. This is a mistake. Please rectify and allow options again. Added: updates harmonized adds, this is good. The avatar issue continues, I award one star. Added added: I have reflected on my star quantity and decided to give the fourth star because even with the choices the devs have made, I realize that it really is a matter of taste; the app is not perfect but it's close."
"It's alright for languages like Italian but when it comes to languages like Korean it sucks. It's buggy and never even explains why certain letters change sound depending on where they're placed. If you want to learn a language like Spanish, English, russian etc. This is a good app. But if you want to learn Korean (example) the best Duolingo can do is teach you the alphabet."
"Super user here. it gets a bit annoying when I'm choosing words to form sentences faster than the app can finish saying them and so whenever I'm putting up sentences the app is spazing like crazy, also would suggest explaining grammaticality some sentences shown like why certain words are put in the places they are, because now it's just ok that's just how it has to be and I have to remember it, ig I could google it tho"
"I like it. I find it hard to learn things a lot of the time, but the way they teach is easy and understandable for me. I do hate that Im not able to make more than 4 mistakes without getting super though. And the personalized practice stuff bieng limited to super is also frustrating, but I understand they need to make money somehow. if you want to learn a language, I think this is a good start."
"I have learned a lot. The constant changes has set my learning back but I have been able to adjust to the latest update better than the first big change. When the change is too big, I usually start over because then I'm faced with words that I haven't been taught. The reason for the 4* is that now on the Android version they have this exercise where they say a word, give you two spellings to choose from and they don't tell me what the word means. I miss the math & music from the apple version."
"So, I'm learning Korean. Duolingo is alright but I think its more useful with vocabulary. When it comes to the listening, sometimes there is nothing to hear and of course the answer given is automatically wrong since you don't hear anything. I like the idea of the leagues but at the same time, I don't. It almost seems to take away from the purpose of learning and makes it a priority to be in competition with others instead of learning. Overall, good app but I like the old version better."
Edited: I have been using this for over 700 days (French) and there a few things I would love to change. I wish it was more consistent. Sometimes it allows for typos but not consistently. And it's very repetitive. I know that's how you learn but 10+ of the same lesson gets old. I also really wish you could choose the subjects. I don't want to discuss social issues or news related things. I use this app to use my brain to learn but also to get a break from normal life.
"Good but very repetitive, there could have been a lot more vocabulary learned. There isn't much variation between lesson styles. Also the way hearts refresh takes a long time and unless you are a paying member, the gem cost is very high and not many ways of gaining them in order to complete the extra levels. Over all seems good, would like the option for European Portuguese."
"The app is helpful to start a language, but it's soo full bugs. The rewards system gets mixups all the time and after a while it's really demotivating. Like in every hour you could watch a short ad and get some credit, but most of the time the icon for it just doesn't appear, or you don't get the coins. Also, the quests are often miscounted, the rewards you would get every 100day just dont happen, so its really annoying. Also, the level of the lessons doesn't always match the level I'm at."
"The newest update seems to have fixed my previous problem with slowness, but now the animations won't move (I've checked the animations setting, but it's on), and it's constantly behaving like I'm in battery saver, but I'm at 100%. I see no battery saver setting in the profile. Please let me know if there is a setting to get me out battery saver mode."
"the application freezes quite often, some voices are incomprehensible at times (they speak very fast), it has maintenance breaks right when one is given a time boost, which is not too often, and one has to compete with the upgraded version of Duolingo's users, leading to upheavals to even maintain a decent position within any league, but mostly within the Diamond one, given all the ads and the lower points one can accrue using the free version. As good as it gets! Thank you üòä üôèüèª"
I have been a duolingo Super user for years. It was a great start; but the app was not helping me to progress in my language study. I want to cancel my subscription. It renewed 8 days ago. My first cancelation request was 3 days after renewal. Doesn't look like Duolingo wants to refund the money. Would have given them a better review before they tried to steal a year's subscription.
"really easy, helpful tips. pretty good to navigate through the setup. would recommend using it if you're trying to learn a new language And you have a hard time focusing on things for along time. you can choose how long your sessions are And the reminders are very helpful. keeps you on track. 10/10"
"Before any feedback, I highly recommend using this app as a training platform, it is very well done! A very good way to start getting the general idea of a new language. I think that the best language to learn on the platform is still English. The other languages tend to have less grammar material to access in the section workbook. Some exercises related to plurals become tricky and it's not clear why both of the phrases are not correct. Pronunciations are weird or inconsistent sometimes."
This is a good app for learning languages. This help me for improving my reading and writing skill for any languages.I will say that this is the perfect app for learning languages those who know nothing this app will change them to a perfect language speaker . by this app I had studied 3 language by 4 months perfectly. This also improved my academic skills in any language exams I can write it properly and score a perfect Mark I was studying in 8th class .THANK YOU DUOLINGO THANK YOU SO MUCH üòäüíê
"They removed offline lessons, you can only do one lesson offline before you have to reconnect to the Internet. I'm going to keep using the app but I can't give this app a good review until they add back such a basic feature. They could make it a paid feature for all I care, just add it back. It's really disappointing to pay $80 for a year of premium just to find out they removed the premium feature I most excited for. Let us download courses!"
"The new interface ruined everything : the system was clear, the progression logical, so why decide to change everything? Everything is mixed up in every section, the ""lesson"" thing is basically useless as it only shows 1 or 2 basic sentences without explaining anything, and most importantly : seems like there's been some kind of mixing up during the transition from one version to another cause I'm now being drowned in preterit verbs that I have never seen and that the app assumes I know..."
"Once you're past the basics, you have to supplement your learning in other ways or you won't progress. I've gone over the word ""suitcase"" at least 100 times while words actually used in daily life are left out. Common sentences are never taught. I'm over a year in and I was asked to translate ""uno, dos, tres"". So again, past the basics, you're better off with a different program."
"I pay for the extra only because I make a lot of mistakes. I don't like how quiet the app is; I have to turn my phone volume so high. Nothing is explained phonetically, so you end up making the same mistakes because of a lack of understanding sentence structure. I turned off the leagues. People def cheat the system. You won't be able to use this app to become fluent. It's good for vocabulary and memorizing words, not actually speaking. Very school based vocab not what you'd use in everyday."
"it's a great app for learning languages and even remembering and practicing ones you know, the gamefied feel enhances the experience and like it's actually dam good, also I don't mind the adds but if your a person who is bothered then you may reconsider since it really does push it's paid version, personally they need to make money too and I didn't really mind it"
"Love this app! The flat art style and gamified visuals makes it more appealing and enjoyableüéÆ! It would be even better if you can add the language ""Sinhala"" (‡∑É‡∑í‡∂Ç‡∑Ñ‡∂Ω). Sinhala is quite a hard language, but it will make Duolingo more accessible for our fellow Sri Lankans. Again, fantastic app. üü©ü¶â (Don't miss your lessons! Duo the owl is watching you at this very second üëÄ)"
"Duolingo is a great language app that gives subscribers an unfair advantage over nonsubscribers. You'll love it if you subscribe to ad-free Super Duolingo. But, as the app warns, you will likely not complete a course if you don't subscribe and pay the lump sum annual fee. The ads are many and distracting. Features and points are fewer, lessons take longer and it's just not as much fun using the free version. Still, it's a good learning tool‚Äîif you can stand the nonstop ads and nag screens."
"Thank you for fixing the too long units issue in Spanish. It is the perfect size right now. It is doable in a week. Please don't change this again. People have yearly goals based on this. Also please bring back achievement progress bar. Update: The words in Spanish is a good addition. Please add a ""random"" sort option to study words at random"
"Great app, I have a 50 day streak so far and it's really helped, I'm learning German but for some reason the for 1 and a half units are talking about things like ""The elephant is smart and tall"" like when will I ever need to say that ever? Also when trying to do the XP ramp up challenge for the leaderboard, I got the the very last challenge, I have done it like 5 times correctly and it refuses to complete it even with 100% accuracy and completion within the time limit."
"Fun, but not deep. Some errors in the lessons. Also, not as customized as they want you to believe. For instance, from time to time, it will want you to practice your ""weakest"" words. This is bogus. It randomly generates words, most of which you have never gotten wrong even once. But it's a pretty good app to get started on a language."
"Can't tell pronounciations apart. I'll pronounce something 5 times before it finally lets me pass. Edit: the voice recognition on this is a joke and it doesn't even put ones you got ""wrong"" into the wrong answers tab if you're just reviewing pronounciations which is one of the hardest things to do. I didn't even finish a sentence and it passed me! Sometimes it stops listening before you finish your sentence! Tricks you into using your points by popping up where you're about to click. Don't pay!"
"I think that Duolingo is one of the very best learning experiences there is. I've been using it to give me a more solid foundation in my Spanish language skills. It's easy to use and very motivating. I've tried Babbel and Rosetta Stone in the past, but I had difficulty making progress and eventually lost interest. Duolingo has allowed me to make solid progress quickly, and that motivates me even more to continue."
"I am giving this app a 1 star because they recently make some horrible changes they NEED to fix. They made the achievements so that you can't track your progress which makes it VERY difficult to set goals for yourself! I KNOW they can fix this because it tracks it until you get your 1st achievement and then you can no longer see your progress. If they fix this, I would give them a MUCH better rating. For now it is SO frustrating!!!!"
I'm really enjoying learning another language and how the game aspect to the app encourages me to keep learning. I'm not learning the words you would normally expect to as the app quickly uses the words you learn into short sentences. Could be improved by learning only one or two new words at a time.
"It is an easy and great way to learn another language. The notifications are useful if you are busy. Edit. If I wanted to learn Arabic the first words to learn would be how to greet people, not noises used within the language and how to write them. Also, how many times in Spanish and French do we need to be reminded that the words taxi, hotel, and pizza are the same or very similar as in English. I have to watch adverts, I pay for super duolingo and it sometimes switches to the non paid version."
"Duolingo is a great tool to help learn a new language. It might have changed since I started my course, but I'd recommend they start courses with alphabet familiarity, rather than jumping straight into ""Where is the plaza"". aside from that, it's great. I am presently not under duress while writing this with a giant green owl in my living room. that'd be ridiculous."
Last unfavorable review was deleted so less stars this time. I mean the app is good but the demotivational notifications are really geting me down. Please stop sending me notifications about how badly I am doing. How about some positive reinforcement? Since the update the ads have become unbearable. Too many ads and ads too long to make learning easy or fun *** whats with the decrepit owl on the app icon? I thought it was to do with my progress but no it's just awful. Removed from my home screen
"Overall it is a good app to learn the basics (only at the beginner stage) the only part that's frustrating in on the what do you hear sections that give you 4 options to pick from you don't get an Idea of what the words mean, just a sound to select and a correct or incorrect result... hoping that as I progress its more of a day to day conversation lessons that will be more helpful"
"Really gone downhill over the last few months. My biggest complaint?? SOOO many of the lessons points...aren't added to my total point score!?! Wouldn't be such a big deal except that THAT'S A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE APP. Tell me, Duo, how have I ""earned a new record high for points""...with a number significantly higher than what my ""total score"" is for the entire week?? üòë Genuinely...stay away. There are other apps. Use them instead."
"It's a very amazing app helping people to learn a new language ,but I would appreciate if you just don't refresh the course and the progress daily because you have to start over and repeating everything again. it feels like you are not making any progress and sometime you loose the motivation to learn because you want to learn not to open the app everyday saying we refresh the course for you and I have to repeat everything I know already"
"The app has a very hard time detecting any voice input causing any voice input qurstions to be skipped. The developers should work harder on the voice input. The other language apps does have this issue. On top of the previous issue, Duolingo is unavailable to correctly keep a streak when the exercise span the day boundary. This is a very frustrating outcome from an app that prone consecutive usage. Life get in the way and I make the effort to learn at the end of the day."
All pronunciations disappeared after the february updates! I can also hear apps sound of the right and wrong answers as well as when the lesson ends. It's impossible to use the app for studying when you don't know how to pronounce the words! Listening exercises are no more. And also I've never been able to practice speaking because of the bug with micro. This is a huge disappointment
"Was great at first, but now that I am advancing, it is not very helpful. While it has you memorize use of words in different context and tenses, there are no explanations of why or language rules. I am constantly trying to figure out when changing tenses why some words you use on o and others you use an e or an a. Good for memorizing a language but not very helpful in understanding the structure or rules of a language. I think they are trying to make this a game rather than a tool."
"Great way of learning a language. The hearts system is confusing and the badges thing should be optional. There is just 1 thing that would bring duolingo to a higher level: there should be buttons all over a lesson that would explain the grammatical rules of each practice. I am learning French and I'm not sure I make the same progress I would make if it would explain the complex system of times, clauses, and silent characters. After 50 days I still have to guess most of the grammatics."
"This app doesn't explain grammar or how the language works in its 'technicalities'. And that is very important. This app just throws you the exercise with the meaning of the words if you hover them. That's great for vocabulary, to memorise. But it fails miserably in other aspects. I wish they had a section with explanations, even if it's behind a pay wall. Also crashes in a middle of a exercise and I am forced to repeat the entire thing. It doesn't record progress. Very frustrating."
"It's very good but there are just a few frustrating aspects. If I skip or add a word on accident but I know better, it doesn't let me go back and correct it by myself until we are reviewing my mistakes. There could be more precise translation words when it gives us choices of what words to put to translate. Oh, and it keeps starting over each day. I'm not sure if that's a bug or just for review but it's really annoying and time consuming. üòÇü§£ I'd give it 3 1/2-4 stars."
"I love Duolingo, but I'm not a fan of the recent updates. Also, the courses for languages that aren't major languages like French, Spanish, and German are hit-or miss. Latin is short and low-quality. Danish (my language of choice) is a hot mess - the English sentences are poorly edited and rarely make any sense. Not to mention that even though I'm on the family plan with two others who can access music and math, I cannot because I have an Android."
"The app is fun and does help with learning a new language. The lessons are entertaining and cute. You get the most out of this app with the benefits of premium. However, if you don't mind sourcing your own extras (flash cards, a targeted mistakes list, ...), this is still a powerful learning tool."
"They changed the entire way the app is a few months ago and my learning experience has declined significantly since then. Am on a 900 plus day streak and I still plan to cancel when my subscription is up. The way it used to be helped me learn so much more. This way seems very forced learning, you just have to be wrong and hopefully remember next time what the word means. Would not suggest duolingo."
"On a few occasions now, I have lost a heart due to the slowness of the app. It delays and then suddenly I have pressed the button to check my answer on the next question (without entering a single word). You're not supposed to be able to continue without entering anything, but due to the delay, it happens regardless."
"The game style makes this feel easy and engaging, the challenges become addictive. The level of repetition is helping vocabulary to stick. I started lower than I needed to revise and it's gradually getting more challenging. the only downside is the USA/South America focus, whereas I'm UK/Spain."
"The app has been crashing a lot lately, especially when loading tests that you pay 100 points to start, or when playing ads, which wastes your time when you're running timed XP boosters. Also, the Russian course does not recognize numbers spoken into the mic, even if you cheat and click the button to replay the sound clip that shows you how to pronounce the numbers in Russian right before you click the button to record your attempt. It makes you fail any speech lessons involving numbers."
"This is a very good app for learning but there are so many things that annoy me. First is that when in accidentally press ""learn new language"" it doesn't let me go out of it. And every time I close the app and open it again it stays the same. 2. When I press the button ""back"" on my phone it shows me the logo of duolingo to go to home and then it stays like that. It freezes everytime. 3. Although the game has many languages I do wish there would be the lanuage Maltese. Even though its unpopular."
"I used to love Duolingo. I have a 1,383 day streak. I even got Super for two years because I genuinely felt like it was worth it. The big update was annoying at first and there's still some changes I really don't like, but some things felt more intuitive at the same time. I've stuck with it. However, upon learning that the company has laid off contract workers in favor of using AI to write lessons, I have canceled my Duolingo Super subscription and I will be looking for a new app to learn on."
"There are many errors in the audio, for example in the Japanese courses. I have reported the errors several times within the app in the past 6 months, but it seems they are not resolving the problems reflected by the user actively enough. Also, in the personal practices, the same questions reappear so often that they've become a waste of time. I have written an email to report the issue two months ago, but the problem persists. To sum up, their trouble-shooting speed is too slow."
"For a basic build-up of vocabulary, duolingo can be good. Overall, though, this app is lacking and inconsistent. Constantly repeats the same 10 sentences for reading and some listening practices until you test out and then delivers completely new terms. This is not how learning a language works. The idea is to build up knowledge, not test unknown terms. Final level for 'Chinese' and Spanish is a basic intermediate level at best."
"I used to love Duolingo app 2-3 years ago, but not anymore. The update consisting the levels has made it less interesting to play/learn . If possible pls bring back the old feature . In addition to that pls remove the ads. It is so annoying. I know money necessary for the developers but I don't like the idea of 'pay to play' . I used to love the time when the stories were not fixed in the learning path but was kept separately. Pls pls bring back the old feature and I will surely give 5 stars."
"the lessons very simple to follow for the most part. Some of the character voices are difficult to understand at times. But the overall app is very well made. I've never received any type of errors. The way they have incorporated learning into a game format, helps to keep your attention. I was skeptical. Months went by where I thought ""I'm just not getting this"". After about 9-10 months, I started hearing Spanish sentences in songs,and I would recognize and understand Spanish written words."
"An amazing app to learn any language you want to. They rectify each and every mistake you make with huge precision specifically trying to understand the mistake and even by providing tips. they even send notifications to remind you take your lessons. I have tried different apps to try and learn languages but this is the best I came across. Highly recommended for one's beginner to pro journey. Just one suggestion for the makers, please add regional alongside international languages like Nepali."
"I've been using Duolingo for a few years now, and while I'm not fluent in conversation, I'm able to read my chosen language fairly well. I can also understand a large part of what people at the supermarket are saying in passing, which I think is a pretty strong point in the favor of this app. The hearts system will forever annoy me, because the app was honestly better without it. But I do like the changes they made to the Chinese course where you can learn pinyin and hanzi, that was much needed!"
"For the most part, this app is fantastic, it's really helped me to be able to learn new languages easily. I'd love to see Maori added to the list of languages available to learn. My only issue is with exp pots, I would like it if the app didn't automatically claim them and I had an inventory system to use them when I wanted. Sometimes I pop on for 5-10 minutes but then end up getting gifted exp that I then feel guilty for not wanting to use it then and there. Let me save them for later please!"
"Cute study app! I have been using it to study Japanese which is a language I already know a bit of. I hear the desktop version is better for learning but I have only used the app and that seems to only be a study tool. They don't explain things very well. I really dislike their league system and the reminders are really obnoxious. Even if you do your lessons everyday you can still get demoted. Not encouraging at all. You can't be in leagues with friends either, which is not fun."
"Hoesntly I love this app! It is so engaging and fun! However, I hope they change the time booster pop up timing. Please edit the BUY time booster button away from the same position we will click CONTINUE. Not sure how many PEOPLE have clicked buy time booster accidentally just because the phone LAGGED or we got too engrossed in the time challenge. It is not very ethical to do this dirty trick for us to click the time booster accidentally."
"Really nice app!üòÄüëè It's just that it takes a very,VERY long time to load.üôÅ(example:when i press the ""Profile"" button,it takes so long to load that i just close Duolingo and i do something else.) I'm not saying its not good but i think there are a few bugs in the app. Last thing: When my friends look at my profile picture,there is no avatar! Otherwise, great app!üòÑ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"If you are trying to learn a more unusual language it really doesn't help at explaining either the grammar or structuring of the language. The words aren't always pronounced especially if there are 2 words in place of one in English, the slower speak seldom works, which makes it difficult to understand. It seems that it is a one size fits all approach to language learning."
"fantastic, has voiced words mostly from what I've seen, with some A.I. filling in. lots of repetition and callbacks, fun little characters that are animated but don't interfere with learning, great stuff. ads dont interfere, just sometimes played at the end of lessons - catchy little ads for duolingo plus, wish it wasn't so expensive... you can totally still learn without it but it would be great to support an app that makes it so easy to learn"
"They want to charge a subscription with a blank price tag, they even went on to write an article entitled ""how much does super duolingo cost?"" with no mention of the price in the article itself or any of the 6 links included in said article. The app itself is good but they continually harass you to pay for premium and sign up to a subscription that they refuse to provide a price for, just bad business practice."
"Fun, but the competition to complete lessons can be too distracting from the actual learning. Pop-up suggestions on how to remember what you learn are good tools. After completing several levels, still can't speak to anyone who knows how to speak Spanish. Lessons go quick, and knowing how to create and speak sentences in Spanish for a conversation is slow. Reading and writing Spanish developed quickly, but lessons make it easy to guess. On it's own, this app probably won't teach fluent Spanish"
"Was a great app, was very thorough and lots of material. Has ads but they're actually not that obtrusive. Unfortunately this app has deteriorated, with previously free features being stripped away, poor running with features load-locked and gems being taken for exercises that either won't load or won't complete. This is likely to push people towards super, which I actually would've bought if not for the poor quality. If it weren't the only place to learn Welsh, I'd avoid it entirely."
"App is usually simple to use, I am using it for Japanese. The biggest issue is the AI voices it uses, for a language like Japanese that has many similar sounds, it often makes me miss because the voice was not clear. It's also rather poor at teaching nuances it just gives you the questions and you tend to need to trial and error through. I am learning slowly, and the bite size lessons are great, but its sub to get more functions and less risk when getting things wrong is very pricey."
"i love Duolingo, it has helped me with my Spanish a lot. I am partially Spanish but I don't speak it fluently so that's why I downloaded it, so far it's helped me speak to other students at my school. I have it on my school computer and I do Duolingo in my free time. the only flaw is every now and then it shows you the add for super duo and it gets kinda annoying because I know that I can't afford it. other than that I'd give it 5 stars. bye bye now!!!"
"Amazing, If you want to learn a language, sorted. There is very little ads and none of them are links were if you touch them a tiny bit it takes you to Google play. One thing. It is less easy to navigate around than previous version but still great"
"Very easy to learn a new language with super duolingo. However, there is no way to get technical help or contact a rep. I lost a 1560-day streak because of a phone issue, and after many failed attempts to find customer service (I don't think they have one), I could not resolve the issue and lost the streak. Also there did not seem to be a way cancel the account,and they continued to charge me.After about a month my old info miraculously appeared, except for the streak. I dunno..."
"Duolingo is not only cute but insanely complex. Yes, you can learn over 10 languages but there's also a psychological memorization algorithm to how this works. It starts by putting basic information into your brain and giving it a good bit of work to slowly seep into your memory, then it gives you more little by little until you can remember the language clearly. That's only the simplified version of what really happens but it's so well thought out and really ingenious. Can't see notifications."
"Duolingo is nice to keep up with practicing but really suffers because you can't choose what to learn or focus on, and it really only does one kind of language learning. I am also not motivated by the artificial mechanisms that boil down to just allowing you to practice more, and all the gems and streaks and ""competition"" don't meaningfully affect the outcome of my learning. I pay for the app, and don't want all that not-what-I'm-here-for clutter and menuing."
"it's really helpful to compete with others every week. But the grammar is a bit neglected. Even new words comes without an article for the first time and one needs to sometimes figure out by yourself or search in other sources. ive also purchased the other most famous teaching app and their grammar is much better. but at the end duolingo has unmatched ability to keep me going and attentive to do every single day. The game also has serious glitches, it does not count properly and has tech issues."
"Duolingo is a really great app. I'd been practicing Spanish for a couple of months and stopped, but then I realised that when I could hear a basic Spanish sentence I could comprehend it. I went back on the app to continue my lessons. The app is built and functions in a way that subconsciously and consciously helps you to absorb the language. It's challenging and it focuses on all aspects of language learning (Speaking, reading, writing, etc) and the rewards and challenges keep me on my toes!"
"Update March 5 2024. I've paid for the premium version (now called super Duolingo) the last 4+ years now. The premium features simply not working consistently and seems to be getting worse. The latest example is the Review Mistakes feature. I made mistakes but nothing ever lists. Also, the unit rewind keeps repeating the same 2 lessons over and over. The stories also seem to cycle through 5 (and it doesn't even highlight which you haven't done like before. what's the point paying premium?"
"Decent introduction to the languages and nice vocabulary builder for new and returning language learners. Some good variety in lessons and examples, but minimal in explanations and can be a little too repetitive. Japanese course is missing speaking practice and more practical lessons like conversations. The hiragana, katakana and kanji is unnecessarily repetitive and takes too long to move on. Lastly the paid version does not have much advantage over the free version."
"Overall I like the app, but I don't like that you have to guess your way through a lot of lessons. Would be nice if there were multiple choices rather than to have to write a whole sentence. The spelling of words is the most difficult part. Also the option in each section where you can collect extra stars should actually pertain to that that section as a refresher and not be random."
"Regardless of the quality of the language teaching, which is so so, this is not a finished app. Quality of performance is worse than any app I've ever used. Can't use it for more than like 10 minutes before it slows my entire phone down to a crawl (no other apps have this problem). To even be able to get a modest amount of learning in in a day requires 1-2 complete restarts of the app. I know this is a common problem with others, but they refuse to do anything about it. Cannot recommend, fix plz"
"General comments: options are there for show only. You can change the as you please but the app still behaves in the same way. English to Korean course: you know you can reduce the amount of explanations for their ""alphabet"" by 90% if you instead explain that the letters indicate HOW the sound is formed, and not how it sounds like ( which is the case in English) English to Japanese: gave up on this one, too much random chances and the staff doesn't seem to care about the course"
"I'm happy to be learning a new language. The thing with Duolingo, though, for better or worse, is it's a competition with others. I understand that it's designed to keep you coming back, and it does, but the problem that presents is faulty scoring resulting in not being awarded points you earned, thus making the game-like aspect of it pointless and frustrating. I've written to them repeatedly regarding not receiving the 15 minute double points, but they do not respond. Terrible customer service."
"As an app on Android, it had worked smoothly, but starting freezing and rebooting the mobile (Android 13, Xperia 5 IV). It can happen two-or three times a day, is not related whether to charging or device temperature. Clearing cache has not resolved the issue. Update (April 2024): the problem dissappeared. Most likely due to fixing the bug in the app."
"1. Please allow us to move the word boxes around in the sentence. It is very frustrating if you forgot one word and have to start all over. This used to be possible a few years ago. 2. When we use voice for numbers, and your programme translate those into numbers (instead of text) amd then you mark that as false.. very frustrating as well. I feel like those are simple implementations that could make a nice difference. Also add some grammar tips to your app to dominate the world"
"It's a good language-learning app, it just doesn't give you enough education in the language. And it is sometimes unhelpful, such as how the Arabic course teaches you a rarely used dialect and the Portuguese course only teaches you Brazilian Portuguese. But overall it was pretty helpful for me, I just don't know where to go to become fluent without having to pay."
"It's good in concept, and obviously popular, and the lessons are well designed. But... I just want the language exercises. I don't want them interrupted every 90 seconds for unskippable dopamine-hit gaming reward animation stuff. And blocking lessons with a video ad for the paid version every 3 to 4 minutes is much more likely to make me abandon it entirely than to pay up for Super mode."
"Please stop forcing Super Duo trials on me. I don't like/want it. Wish they'd add story time + speaking to Hebrew. Good for getting a grasp on a new language, though. Update: Newest version took away all discussion boards, which were a great way to get advice & be able to hear almost every sentence. We now lose hearts practicing old lessons if we click into specific ones, which disincentivizes practicing old lessons. The path update forces you to new materials too fast, so you don't learn well."
"Duolingo was amazing before the current update now. I miss the repeated lessons & crowning levels. It made diffenciating lessons easy. But now its all mixed in with old & new/unfamiliarized questions, plus the update lags so hard. And, there's no hearing the sentences in the lessons once completed anymore which is really unfortunate. It's frustrating to learn sentences when I've never came across them before. I liked how it was a year ago."
"This is a painless and fun way to learn a new language! The system is highly motivational and encourages daily practice to speed up progress , so I am very happy with Duo. The only slight reservation is that the translations/vocabulary are American English which can sometimes be confusing for a UK learner! Apart from that, I can highly recommend Duo!"
"Great at teaching very basic stuff. But spends more time trying to be a game than a teaching app. Often just throws words at you and expects you to know them right away, then punishes you for getting them wrong. When it works, it creates a great cycle of engagement, but when it doesn't, it creates a vicious cycle of discouragement. Fun app, but not great for teaching."
Has been very good up to now but it seems to have a major glitch in last 3 weeks and I'm stuck in a Groundhog day loop constantly repeating Unit 6 of the Spanish course! This happens after a screen message appears stating: 'We're syncing your progress to new and improved Spanish course content.' it's very frustrating. I've contacted Duolingo support but have not received any answer.
"I love this! It's super easy to help you learn languages, and learning Spanish couldn't be simpler. But, on my phone, I'm 3 days behind on my streak than I am on my iPad. I'm on 24 days on my iPad, while on my phone it says I'm on 21. And the Duo widget NEVER loads for me. Plus, when I accidentally clicked free trial, it would let me cancel the free super duo trial until it finished. But overall, this app is super simple to help learn languages and I heavily recommend it everybody."
I'm doing What I have always loved to do and I get to do it in a far less clunky (getting stuck somewhere where it's imperative to know a specific Paiste or you're NOT gonna get far...) means of fast learning sans the dangers that make fast learning a necessity and not some fun bar trick!! thank you duo lingo for helping me expand my knowledge of language!!! You're the best!
This is a very good app to accompany you when learning a new language. It keeps you quite engaged and motivated. Since the discussions/forum part was removed from the exercises the App keeps you guessing what the rules are to the sentences you are learning. For example there is now no way to know why a sentence is formed in a certain way without leaving the app and googling or opening an actual grammar book. Quite frustrating.
"Recently the speech broke for me. I can no longer do speaking exercise. It just doesn't allow me any time to speak before it jump to complete. It has been happening consistently. Please fix it in future release. Still unfixed, had to leave Duolingo and unsubscribed for the next year. This is really frustrating. after using it for a few years, I won't come back until they fix various bug from Android side. So disappointing."
"So much to love, with engaging lessons, the romanji option as well as learning hiragana. The negative is that there's a LOT of repetition on each lesson, which not everyone needs. Also lots of questions like ""where is the airport"", which no-one asks, with smartphones and googlemaps now! I'd prefer more vocabulary options earlier, like flashcards to start building more nouns in a memory bank."
"I have been on Duolingo since last January, almost a year. I am on level 8 and there is a bug that does not permit me to check an answer. I have reported the bug but there is absolutely no communication as to what action if any is being taken. Very disappointed with this app. To continue to learn Spanish I will have to try another app. I was making progress learning Spanish and frustrated by the way this is managed. Terrible!! I am dissatisfied and would never recommend Duolingo."
"I find that learning French this way is challenging. Often there are no references to the correct way to conjugate the verbs. Even the examples won't show the correct choice. So I use the example and get it wrong. Also, the speaking lessons often don't hear what I am saying when though I say the phrase exactly correct. They say learning English is very difficult. Well, the French don't say half of the letters in any given word, so how is one supposed to know that?"
"I have been taking the course of the language Norweigan and High Valyrian (which I adore and appreciate for them learning and adding it here), and so far, everything has been great! I have been learning and discovering a variety of words and phrases, and despite how I am currently in the rookie level, I am at least able to form a full sentence and phrases with the newfound words I learnt. This app is really helpful, and on top of that, entertaining too!"
"Good for learning. But some issues. I pay for it but leave heart's on so I can try harder to learn, but I can't do practice to recover more hearts when I pay for it like the unpaid version. Which is annoying to lose functionality after you pay for something. Also I like the animations on duo but don't like samsung animations when changing apps. And if I turn off the samsung animations it turns off the duo lingo animations. Even if it is toggled on in the settings of the duo app."
"I've been using it for a bit now & have no complaints so far üëåüèæ Their premium plan for the year is cheap imo. I immediately started using the premium plan but was using the free one for a couple weeks. From what I remember, users still have access to everything but there are certain restrictions. I appreciate the choice! Having full access to everything the app has to offer, but with restrictions, for free is generous üëèüèæ"
"inconsistent with what passes as correct answers, (spelling errors etc) will auto select answers so you get wrong answers and lose stars. Constant ads. They just want you to pay for subscriptions. I've also been told by finnlanders that this isn't the language/ grammar used for actual conversations. In my opinion if you can afford it go with another app"
"Great app! I'm a visual learner and the audio lessons, YouTube, and even flashcards don't work for me. I need to see the written word in a context and associate it with an image in order for me to assimilate new vocabulary. It works better for me than Memrise does, because it covers the grammar and Memrise doesn't. Duo also has stories and mini games which make the language learning more entertaining, which is a key to success for an ADHD person like me."
"My experience would be much better if Duolingo didn't have so many bugs. Or, at least, if their support team really tried to solve the problems and not only sent you letters kinda ""We've received your report, thank you!"". One of the bugs is especially discouraging. Duolingo takes off your XP! For example, you gained 75 XP at level 12 of Match Madness, but Duolingo adds up only 60 XP to your score! I've found out on Reddit that this bug is more than a year old, and Duolingo still hasn't fixed it."
"I have enjoyed using duolingo for over a year now. Though I haven't appreciated some of its more recent updates. It is slowly becoming more game style and less educational. But after trying other language apps, I've still always come back to duolingo. It doesn't teach you the language rules, etc, but I find it very helpful to learn new words and help me stay familiarized with the language as I learn it through BJU's curriculum."
"The app has mostly worked fine, but lately, I keep passing level 30 in French, starting level 31, only for the app to reset overnight to level 30. Then I jumped ahead to level 32 and did a couple more activities, only to get reset to midway through level 31. I have no way of contacting an actual person over this and can only submit a bug report that just gets an automated response. I'm not sure if there's any point to using this app going forward."
"A good app to learn the basics, but I've just encoutered a major problem : xhile leasing Chinese, I had progressed to stage 4 and was in the middle of it. But they implemented a major change in the order in which we're learning the words and sentences. As a result, some levels are now considered as completed (stage 1, 2 and 3), but for some of them, it's not what I've learned. I basically have to erase everything and redo it, as I've missed some vocabulary and grammar because of that."
"App is generally great but falls down badly when doing speaking exercises with short (one or two syllable) phrases. It often fails to recognise short phrases, across several languages. Tested this with a native speaker in Turkiye, where Duolingo failed to recognise him speaking his own language. The result is a long list of ""mistakes"" you can't get rid of. EDIT Feb 2024: There are still issues with voice recognition, but it seems they no longer appear as mistakes which need to be fixed."
"I love this app . It's really good for learning a language . But there is a bid since 2-3 days it says complete a lesson to join this week's leaderboard and then when i do i am still not in the leaderboard . Yesterday I had practiced 10-11 times but still my XP remained the same , it didn't increase at all. please fix this ASAP"
"duolingo is a great app to learn simple languages such as Spanish, however, it does not teach you proper conjugations and stem changes(such as ""o-ue"" or ""e-ie""). also, the hearts force to thrive for no mistakes, so I would take away that. but otherwise, it is a great app!"
"There are problems with both the language I am learning not being presented correctly and with the English used. There is no learning of grammar rules, and it can be very repetitive. The app itself is also very unstable and will hang frequently, which is especially annoying if you lose XP during a 2x period. There's adds after every lesson but half of them are from Duolingo themselves selling the Super or Family plan. However, overall, it's a fun way to learn basic phrases of a language."
"Duolingo is fun, the animations, voices and characters with their different personalities makes it so much better than all the other language-learning apps and websites I've tried. I don't use premium, but I got GIFTED it as a prize in one of the treasure boxes for three days and it was completely free!! My only problem is that it shouldn't take a premium to review our mistakes, and we should get more of the blue coins more often, as I want to make everything Legendary but it is hard to save up"
"I love this app. It really helps me sharpen my listening skills. I'm building my vocabulary and I'm understanding more of what I hear. However, after playing for 64 days my only complaint is that the Legendary Lessons has a major glitch that needs to be fixed ASAP! Oftentimes when trying to translate a sentence the letters turn red indicating that the word cannot be chosen thus forcing me to forfeit that lesson altogether. This has been happening for a few weeks now. Please help!"
So far so good. There are lots of languages to choose. I am at the beginner level and it seems very beginner to me. There is repetition to help reinforce learning and they have a streamline way to respond to questions. The lessons are bit size so it's long enough impact but not to long to feel like a chore. Even the ads are placed in a pretty good spot after a lesson which gives users a mini break. It's not perfect but I would def recommend and have. It's free with an option to upgrade.
"now I've been using it for a while. I still think it is good, but extremely annoying . it's South American, not Spanish. It's designed to annoy you into paying for. the main encouragement is the competition, which is addictive but impossible to win without paying. they also give you rewards, but also remove them often. then we have adverts that regularly crash to delay and demotivate you unless you pay, but then who could expect more?"
"Great for beginners. I haven't used it to learn more advanced topics but it's a great collection of words, pronunciations and phrases to get you thinking in the language you wish to learn. Edit: lowered from 5 to 3 stars due to the recent update removed gboard's predictive text. This was a poor decision. Without this, there's less benefit to using the mobile version or to pay for a subscription. Second edit: raising back to 5 stars since they quickly fixed the issue with predictive text"
"I miss when my feed was all about my friends accomplishments and less about random duolingo articles I do not care about. I want to see what my friends are doing and send congrats to keep ourselves motivated, not learn about soccer and football. The translations have also been a bit weird lately, as someone who is mostly using the app to review/keep up practice with a language rather than learning from zero. The app used to be better."
This app is very good and here its very fun to learn a language.. but the problem is that when it says in a particular voice i cant understand it clearly... its like half the word is loud n clear and the other half is just gone or i have to turn my volume full..it emphasises on letters in starting of a word.. and it dosnt happen for ever word. Why does it have to do that?? I am learning spanish since a yr now. Also the sentences just keeps on repeating.. dosnt duolingi have more sentences??
"The overall experience is ok. The translation questions sometimes demand improper english or odd phrasing. The app doesn't give an explanation for why you missed a question. Sometimes you get the translation they were looking for, or an occasional example that has nothing to do with the question you missed. It not only fails to clarify much, it prompts ""was this a good explanation?"" without any option for no. There's bugs too. I've learned a lot of words, but no real way to use them together."
"There are many good things about Duolingo and I have learnt a lot in a few months, but it could be much better. There isn't enough explanation for why certain words or grammar are used. There isn't an option for choosing what you learn - I'm learning Spanish for a holiday and so don't really need to plough through sections on education and work. It constantly says I'm learning a new word for words that have been taught previously, and the speaking exercises are hit or miss."
Great app for learning a new language. Will it make you fluent? Probably not. But it gives you the foundations for free or an affordable cost for most people and allows you to try different languages. You can do it from wherever when you have time which is remarkably convenient.
"App is great, customer service not so much. Somehow got my path unlocked by 8 whole sections, and I then had to manually go back and find where my progress was. Also, i was no longer receiving rewards for chests along my path as they were already open. Sent in a help ticket on 3/13/24 and have gotten zero response from Duolingo. It's a fun app, but 2 stars and a canceled subscription due to the lack of assistance."
"Seriously, you just saying ""You're wrong"" without any explanation as to why completely defeats any kind of purpose you are trying to accomplish here. This missing feature makes the app worse and worse and worse as you go through the lessons and only serves to reinforce bad habits. You NEED to add WHY you are wrong rather than saying the right answer with ZERO explanation. Seriously considering moving to another language-learning app."
"Samsung S23 Ultra (Android). I've been using Duolingo for almost two years now (started JUN 2022). Upgraded to a S23 Ultra in MAY 2023 from a S10, but still having trouble with the app freezing upon opening. About once a week (or more often) I have to Force Stop the app because it won't open. Also, would be nice to know what I did wrong, if I make a mistake (not all errors show corrections). What happened to the tip-suggestion area for each question in a lesson?"
"the only reason I do not rate 5 stars is because tracing characters (for these types of languages) is odd on a PC versus a mobile screen. it would be nice to have a chance to be warned before a tracing lesson, or have the option to do them later, similar to the listening exercises. everything else is great. love learning on this app."
"it feels like there is no real content. this is gamified to the point that I do not think I am learning anything. it just tries to give you dopamine hits with flashy animations and sounds. I do not need to repeat the same 5 things 20 times over and over when it is already known. I do not believe you can learn a language with this, but you can be entertained by it and feel clever."
Tbh the learning app Is really competitive with this leagues. You forget your here to learn a language because you get caught up in competiting with others .As well as this is not suitable if your a busy person because of this leagues and striks I mean shouldn't we be learning not competing with ppl.I don't really like this side of the app it's really annoying and yeah the language part which we should be focusing on is good .
"Otherwise good but lately they broke my favorite feature: ""practice to earn hearts"". Now it gives always same words. Please fix it, practicing learned words helps me to remember them otherwise I'll forget them Update: Now it's even getting worse there are randomly some exercises that are like more than 10 times harder than other exercises. Seriously guys what are guys have been doing last 2 weeks, this app is now totally unusable, I can't learn language like this."
"Duolingo is a very good place to start learning a language. When you get to intermediate or advanced, I find myself having questions that the app just doesn't answer. Plus lately they've changed the icon to some droopy face which I really don't like."
"It was a great app when I joined in 2020. Took a year off. The new structure is useless. Learning Concepts and Grammer concepts are not even introduced. The so-called Guidebooks are also useless. You are asked to pick the pronunciation between 2 words & not told what the word means. It's just conversations. USELESS. You have to introduce gender concepts, grammar and verb tense usage etc. to learn. Just throwing new words at you without any explanation is ridiculous."
"Wish there was more explanation (e.g. verb tables, plural rules etc) and it is REALLY annoying that English is American English, with no option for British English. Yes, I can usually work it out, but it slows me down (and many challenges are timed in duolingo) and is confusing. The language I'm learning often shares words with British English, that I then need to translate to American! Plus, presumably everyone learning English will be learning American English with no choice üòî"
"My husband & I started duolingo together & have been impressed with the program. Working through the language in a variety of ways is very helpful. I do recommend doing the membership it allows for unlimited attemps, where the free method you get hearts and with each mistake you loose a heart. When the hearts are gone no more practice. Making the program not as productive or beneficial. The repetitive nature is the key to learning a new language."
"A restructuring of the Chinese course has completely messed up everything. For some reason I had to relearn some courses that I've already learned. What's worse is that the course made me skip some lessons I've haven't done yet. It now assumes that I know around 30 or so words that were never taught. Me keeping notes have just gone out the window, guess I was a fool for trying to organize them. I've canceled my premium subscription, will stop using the app once it runs out."
"Progression is very slow, and the lives mechanic is terrible. Learning is about making mistakes, but you can't make mistakes without getting kicked out for 4 hours. Ive been getting lessons of the same five words, then one is added, then those six words, each day for the last three. At this rate ill be fluent in 2070"
"This app really teaches whether you get the premium or not. I have started to learn a language on Duolingo a few years ago and I am now more than the average of someone speaking a language of a country they're not even in. with no one speaking German where I live, I have learned a lot and am able to communicate pretty well. As part of school studies to learn French, I have also kept going in Duolingo to have quick lessons on weekends too. Overall this is a great app to learn any language, really"
"a decent platform that seems to slowly be falling into a pay to learn ideology, moving away from its languages for all focus. the internal gem system arbitrarily increases, stopping progression and ads to buy an AI enhanced version are too common. Hopefully Duo address this as is love to give more than 3 stars, but to many minor detractions for me"
"Just used the app for the first time in a couple of years, and it has gone downhill. Has become a typical annoying app begging for money and forcing you to watch ads. The pronunciations audio clips are inconsistent and are not great for teaching how words sound. Used to be much better and I could easily knock out an hour of learning. Now I think I will delete my account"
"Powered by AI? A recipe for disaster. After a 400+ days streak I've decided to uninstall. They laid off a LOT of people and replaced them with AI, but the AI isn't even good! There's A LOT of mistakes in most languages, weird grammar that a native speaker would NEVER dare pronounce and, of course, an absurd amount of straight up incorrect translations, losing the true meaning of idioms and the nuances of the language. I'll be back when you hire HUMANS and re-open the forums."
"I love this app!!!!! the lessons are short, helpful and help you learn efficiently! it's a shame sometimes you run out of hearts and have to quit that lesson for 24hrs or something, and it would be nice if they introduced a community bit maybe so you can practise speaking/writing the language with actual people üòÖ bit I love it so much and it really does help soooo much when trying to learn difficult new phrases and grammar!!!!!!"
"Do NOT care about their (free) customers! Since the redesign, things have changed for the worse. The tips before lessons have been replaced with unhelpful ""guidebooks"". The helpful ability to comment was disabled on Android. Now there's no help or reasons given when something is new. There's no learning, only memorization. Learning went from fun to being a chore. This review was 1st left 6 months ago. Still no response. I email them often, but get no response since I quit the paid version."
"A good way of learning a completely new language for this beginner. Lots of nudges to keep you engaged. Every now and then there are words that are not explained before they are used, but most of the time you can click on them to see what they mean or you soon learn them. The app functions well, I've had no crashes or bugs. Adverts are not too intrusive as they appear between lessons, and there is a way to pay for an advert free version with many other benefits. Yo soy muy feliz con Duolingo."
I just started the app. I did have previous experience with Spanish the language I wanted to learn first. I didn't feel my knowledge of Spanish would be enough to start at a harder spot so I started at the beginning. The app does offer the option to test your knowledge for a starting point too. I just wanted to start from the beginning. I am still using it on the free play plan. Using watching ads to keep it free for me. Mi espa√±ol es improving but I haven't learned it all yet. It teaches to rea
"Edit: the app has been very glitchy lately. It keeps adding pronunciation helpers even though I have it off. Plus I don't get credit sometimes. Japanese course is kind of odd. I took lessons in college, and picked this up to refresh. There are skips for lessons, but no skip for characters, so I have to go through ALL the kana I already know. Plus the pronunciation for single kana is very muddled and hard to hear. And why teach kanji for Kyoto before the days of the week or basic animals?"
"I don't know if this will happen if you continue your lessons, but as a native Vietnamese speaker, the Vietnamese selection is not accurate. Sure, it is accurate for certain topics, but most of the time, not. The app only uses one version/dialect for words and does not differentiate between ""pronouns."" The pronunciation is also from one dialect, not others. It is, btw, too formal. For example, you would not have to say ""xin l·ªói"" every time, like ordering food, unless you're sorry for something."
"Very good. This app provides you with a lot vocabulary and after a time you can build long sentences and learn a language very quickly. Duolingo is also very colorful and has systems like streaks and your stats that motivates you to keep learning a new language. Me personaly having a Spanish class, it really helped me get a head start over other students. So if you are looking for an app that really teaches you a new language, then Duolingo will not let you down."
"Was good, excellent in fact. Making terrific progress. However last few days the app has appeared so buggy and so mamy issues. Tried emailing support but received nothing in return. App gives false notifications. No promotion due to bugs. No xp due to bugs. The thing is full of bugs. Update: tried clearing cache and destroyed all of my progress since last week??!!"
"Devs could think more about league allocation. My husband is very competitive.He will play as long as it takes to stay at the top. He often gets put in easy leagues so he doesn't have to do much = less adverts. I am less competitive. I get put into challenging leagues with superusers where I'd have to play full time to succeed! So I do the minimum as I know there's little hope of advancing = less adverts. If the leagues were better set, we'd both do more = more adverts, happy users & advertisers"
Whenever I complete a friends quest the quests are not added up in the menu. And they give us 50 quests to complete in just 30 days but still sometimes don't add up the quests in the bar. Have been facing this problem since 3 months and there are many more probs when you don't update the app I have to check everyday for updates. At first the lessons were for free and there were no adds but now they are just screwing the free version users by giving them these problems. Injustice pure injustice.
"Every day new problems. I don't have double XP from lessons after i get the double XP potion, sometimes I see transcriptions even when I turn them off. ||| Every time a course update happens, I have to redo most units, and have legendary lessons with words I have never seen in my life. This just demotivates me from doing more lessons that one to save my streak. Please stop updating the courses like this and bring back discussions."
"I've used duolingo every day for a year to practice Japanese, but I find the constant (unannounced) course updates are increasingly making the app unusable. It's really frustrating to log on and find that every few months you're suddenly at a completely different place in the course, with random content which is either too easy/hard or contains new kanji you are expected to 'know'. Japanese duolingo also lacks content (eg stories) and doesn't teach kanji well. I might find another app instead."
"After the recent update, I can't play because it always says ""you are offline"" even when my wifi is on. I'd like this to be rectified and what's up with the constant update, New problems keep arising for me after every new update. With the new update, the app just got worse, I can't practice, it keeps closing and now my streak has been reset, I think I'll have to delete this app it's becoming a total waste of space"
"Animations for words appearing on the word-match exercises are too slow. They take forever to appear on both columns, all the while the clock dwindles. They should appear instantly, not fade in like a bad Powerpoint. I get ""speedy"" grades on the regular levels but those bonus levels are ""merde"". I'm not playing it again until this is fixed as i don't like leaving levels behind without obtaining all stars. I'll maybe use Babbel instead. Frustrating as i'd sank a couple of weeks into Duo."
I have loved this app and been a user for the past decade but have noticed some bugs that should be fixed. The app glitches frequently and restarts and freezes often. I've reported these glitches and they do improve for a short time. It makes me not want to purchase the Duolingo plus edition. This really sucks to write this but it's true. Also lessons no longer have a proper grammar section that would enhance the lessons. Just sentences that are vaguely similar to that lesson.
"Korean: A bunch of the audio files for Korean are really really bad, they are glitchy and jittery sounding. There is no way you can learn Korean using this app alone. It can be a good supplemental source when using something else as your primary. However, these corrupted audio files can still be very frustrating and unhelpful. I would say absolutely do not pay for this app if this is the language you are wanting to learn."
"It's a fun refresher game to do alongside learning a new language, and I appreciate that the only ads I'm getting are for their other services. But while doing these exercises, I'm often thrown words that I haven't been taught in the Duo lessons, and I do think that while the lesson guides are helpful to some extent- they don't necessarily cover everything in the lessons. It can be a bit vague."
"I am using the free version for French and learning a lot! Practicing to earn hearts is a good thing, but there are lots of opportunities with the paid version too (I won 3 free days), so you will be able to achieve your language goals with either one. The app could benefit users by making a ""theory"" tab or something to teach users about the finer points of language use (fem/masc, plurals, origins, etc). One has to dig a bit for this knowledge in the app. Tr√®s bien! ü¶âüíö"
"Somehow they managed to push out updates to make the UX significantly worse than it was before, and it was bad enough then: now it has a number of unskippable animations that ignore the Animations setting and significantly increase the time it takes to do anything on the app; it continues to load keyboards that aren't installed but now it also straight-up loads the wrong keyboard at times; the voice recognition is still awful. There are better alternatives out there."
"While I've enjoyed and learned a lot from duolingo in about a years time, they've changed the course I've been taking three times in the duration. One of the core features of duolingo is its ability to teach you language, add on top of what you already know, and refresh your knowledge periodically. Unfortunately, in the latest update to my language course, I now have tens, if not hundreds of words that duolingo says I've learned, but have never seen before. There is no way to relearn these words"
"A great app to learn the basis of a language and get familiar with the words and sounds. However, I think it can only get you that far without proper learning courses. It is still awesome to keep practicing, and definitely fun as well!"
"Used to be a huge fan, haven't used for a couple of years, now it's littered with ads, pesters you constantly if notifications are turned off, it has a limit on the amount of time you can use it and when I was brushing up on my skills and when translating ""Wien is great"" and I got it wrong for using Gro√üartig instead of Super, I knew it was time to install something else like Memrise. I wonder if that has also gone rapidly downhill from where it was a few years back."
"Ever since the Japanese course on the app was updated, I've noticed this frustrating issue where the app isn't correctly placing where I am in the lessons. For example, I noticed I've done 4 lessons in one bubble, but when i close out of the app and restart it, it shows I've only done one. It's kind of irritating, so please fix this as soon as possible."
"An amazing way to become bilingual..By way of lessons as well as short story lines for you to advance your skills you've learned. I would love to say that I love this app...But it's so unfair for months I keep reporting that in the recovery mistake section ,I've answered correctly over and over and yet...It won't give me my right answer credit or mark my answer right.It keeps marking my correct answer as wrong when it's right...It's been months on end.."
"I absolutely love DuoLingo! I knew some very basic Spanish but wanted to improve as we were headed to Mexico for a month. I've been able to have conversations with the locals! Amazing. I love that there are different characters with different accents, tone, speed, etc. Different ways to reinforce the learning and very motivating with the challenges. Highly recommend!"
"Excellent app for learning new languages. Definitely motivated by the leadership board but also by the threatening and or disturbing messages I get, terrorizing the other characters or threatening me and my family personally, and the horrifying late night images on the widget. There are a lot of languages to choose from too which is pretty cool. 5 Stars would recommend."
"App suddenly has a bug. No XP despite earning it. Double XP chests haven't activated. Not recognising my progress for the league - so I'm stuck at the bottom, despite completing enough lessons to be at the top. I've also ended up paying for the app for a year as I thought it was ¬£4.99 a month and planned to cancel the ad free version after one month. Gutted to see ¬£60 has gone from my bank account and will auto renew in a year's time. Achievements hadn't activated either. Disappointing."
"I have reduced my mark because some of the English grammar used in Duolingo is poor. For example for loud music the English translation is ""full blast"". At best this is American slang. The correct translation should be "" at full volume"". Also the use of ""gotten"" is incorrect. The correct translation should be ""became"" Because of this type of thing I find myself bring marked as incorrect when I am answering correctly."
"Is a good app. But have technicals problems like, when I finish a lesson and I press continue, I can't continue with my next lesson, doesn't stop loading and I have to close the app, lose my day progress and do everything again. Also, sometimes a make like 200 EXP and looks like I didn't do anything, I stay in the same position. I would like them to fix these few problems that I mention because there are more. Thank in advance."
"A very good app, easy way to develop a habit of daily practice. This app is a good conversation companion you have no one to practise with. I like the way the lessons build on each previous one. The reading lessons that seem to throw words at you that you never came across before! Well I suppose it makes your learning muscles strain harder to develop faster. One more thing, when you say something is free then let it all be free üòÅ. That for me is what holds back my fifth star for the app."
"I've studied Spanish off & on throughout my adult life, from high school, thru college & beyond. I have never been able to learn so quickly & retain all the info so easily, while having fun, than I have with DUOLINGO. My only complaint about the free app is that some of the ads can be way too long & annoying. But it is free, so I can't complain too much."
"Don't bother contacting support w/your concerns. They don't respond. I've submitted requests several times and not ONE single response. First off, there are 4 different dialects in Vietnamese, and they mainly teach northern dialect, but there are different ways of saying the words depending where you are from. Also, it's difficult trying to make the timed lessons when they make you type out all these long sentences. Make the sentences shorter, or provide speaking as an option with it."
"I think I really did learn a lot. it's not much yet and I would love to keep going, but I can form basic sentences in my chosen language now. the characters and style of the app is adorable. premium is cheap, it genuinely works, and having a long streak is cool too. you get rewards and can have friends. definitely recommend for anyone. perfect for first timers and people with some experiences, to anyone like just wanting to touch up your speaking or spelling in a language. üíû"
"Many of the practise phrases are in the wrong order pedagogically. In language-learning a learner should hear the phrase first, then fill in a single word gap in a phrase, then reproduce the phrase after hearing it spoken. Finally the learner translates the full sentence from English into the target language. In many of the sections, this final phase comes first, then the other, less difficult phrases follow randomly. This happens throughout the Italian course and needs modification."
"Updated unexpectedly and completely reorganized the lesson plans, throwing me into a unit where I was totally unprepared. Now I have to start over, because the earlier lessons contain vocabulary that wasn't trained pre-update, but it still counts this as ""review"" (even though I never got to learn it before), which awards a measly 5xp per lesson. Absolutely aggravating."
"I was learning chinese, but recently, the course seems to have updated. The sync that happened wasn't done properly and the course has worsened. I just started unit 3 of chapter 1 before the update, but now this unit has been shifted to become unit 1 (which doesn't make sense). The biggest problem is that Duolingo thinks I have completed the current unit 1 as well as a part of unit 2, while I had only done one circle of unit 3. Now I can't continue learning properly. Please don't delete units."
"I've been learning French for a year, so I can only speak about learning French. Duolingo is good, it presents good challenges, constantly switches between listening, watching and speaking. It doesn't explain all subjects well, which has caused me to be stuck, loose hearts/streaks. I would say use Duolingo as a basis and use it at the same time as watching TV shows/movies/interviews in the language you're learning. Super Duolingo isn't worth it. I prefer using the Web version without the hearts."
"Learn the language you want at a natural pace that feels fun, like a video game. The app itself is hilariously sassy when you don't practice, with lots of fun in incentives to practice every day like tournaments, streaks, achievements, friends, etc. and lots of different ways to learn listening and speaking at a pace that feels natural. I love Duolingo!"
"Pretty decent. But the ads after every lesson and limited hearts make learning a language needlessly harder. I only got the ads after going onto the app and haven't checked the web version since, so maybe that version doesn't have as many ads. Also, if you run out of hearts,then you either need to gain more through paying with crystals (things you get either through quests or irl money) or doing some practice for one more heart. If you run out then you stop. Overall, it's not the worst nor best."
"This app is rlly good for learning languages. I've been taking spanish, German and italian for a straight 80 days. My friend, that also learns Spanish and Chinese has a streak of 1 year it's a rlly good app and it's updates are rlly good. If you want to learn a language use this app it's super good and amazing for understanding and learning other languages"
"They updated it recently, at least the Chinese lessons, and added new words and characters in sections and units I've already completed in their entirety. This means I have to go all the way back to the beginners lessons just to learn new words that could've easily been placed in a newer, separate section. This is just counterproductive and frustrating because I like organization, and this just screwed over my pacing."
"I don't like the change to the learning path. It doesn't feel well structured. XP is harder to earn. Lesson states XP for a specific lesson, but after completing it I was awarded less XP. In some cases XP was not awarded at all. I have lost interest in the app and now feel unmotivated to do multiple lessons. The changes seem geared towards forcing you to complete the learning path in order to earn any XP, and penalises you by awarding a tiny amount of XP for practicing earlier lessons."
"Android experience with the mic just got worse in a recent update. I have to over-anunciate/pronounce words like ""d√≥lares"" and ""veintisiete"" incorrectly to be understood on Android. Was not always this way. IPad experience is different, but we only have 1 apple device for a family and it's not with me like my phone is. Also, as a Super user, still have to exit and return to get daily challenge and xp to update sometimes. Going on vaca soon & sad I might have to lose my streak to practice IRL."
"While I'm happy with the format of the app, the review part needs some work. I could play it a hundred times and nothing would change. The reviews only show me lessons I've learned recently and I'm starting to forget the basic words from the beginning of the course. Every course or platform is a completely different experience too. Web has the vocab which I would love to do on the app but tough luck, I've heard of events I've never even seen on my course, and quests are different on web and app"
"I am just shocked how most of the lessons in almost all the units are organised. When you run out of heart to use, you can practice even more to gain heart I've learnt a lot from this app but the only short coming that I think it has is that you cannot get to know your (Quest) buddies unless you've meet in person or know each other from somewhere It would have been good to have some quest that you can complete with a friend that is active. But all in all, this app is Maverick. Merci, DuoüòÅ"
"I do not understand the software development and testing process they use at Duolingo! Honestly! For years and years we see the same problems coming back all the time. Currently, the problem is that Today's review is stucked to Listen-up. I did like 20 of listening exercises in a row - it sux! Killing Duo is not helping. Alo, all books are marked read when I arrive to them. Kind of difficult to get daily achievements! Argh!"
"App rewards me with 15 minutes of double time but in actually does not. Been glitch since recent update (April 2024) Unfortunately, they took away the comments after each lesson/screen which was super helpful in learning how to correctly pronounce words in Japanese. Sometime a character has several ways of saying it depending on the use. Please bring it back. Being able to hear the language one is learning is super helpful."
"I used to enjoy the app, leaning a new language was fun and excited. but it sucks that you guys care more about money than providing a good, (mostly) free, accurate language learning app. getting rid of translators to use AI has made it unfun and annoying. hearing words pronounced incorrectly, being told my answers (which I know are correct) are wrong, the accents are odd, etc. I am undownloading, and will consider re-downloading if you bring back actual, human translators."
"Duolingo definitely got more cash grabby, and hasn't put much thought into the system to let their users actually learn, for example, the streak freeze costs less than a heart refill, which doesn't incentivize theusers to actually keep working. Also, it shows that the premium subscription is needed to actually learn seriously. Imagine you need to learn a new language for travel and you have to pay with gems to keep going lmao. Other than the downsides, still an app I frequently use."
"I enjoy the learning in a game, it's very engaging! It is fun, and the sound effects motivate me to continue playing. However, the gems you can win to continue advancing to higher skill levels is RIGGED to force you to pay money for more gems. And the coast of more gems is not reasonable at all. The coast of certain things is so ridiculous relative to what you recieve for it, and their are challenges that can't be beaten without paying for more time, which is un ethical for a learning app. üëéüèø"
"Very flawed. Terrible lag after studying for more than 30 minutes makes it almost unusable. Many times it freezes and does not count points earned. Several times it has marked me as incorrect where I have used a word that means the same thing. Some open ended questions are marked wrong when what I have written is grammatically & factually correct, just not the answer the app was looking for. Overall a good idea, badly implemented. Would give it zero stars if possible. DO NOT PAY FOR THIS."
"I really love Duolingo, it makes learning a new language fun, easier and quicker. I like the streak system, the different modes of learning (writing, listening, selecting). I love how there's also an option to select 'Can't listen right now'. I feel like Duolingo in a sense has revolutionised the speed & learning languages. The challenges, leaderboard, badges and quests keeps engagement and a sense of healthy competition. I've learnt so much in so little time & felt so accomplished!"
"I am learning so much with the free version. The lessons have various ways of learning that keep me engaged and I love keeping my streak...it's very motivating. I have tried another similar app, but I must say, this is my favourite! Using the app is handy for anywhere, but using it online skips the ads. I use both. If there were a lifetime subscription I would purchase it! Absolutely recommend this!"
"Too much repetiton, often answers are limited to particular combination of words an sentences. Progress is too slow. Many ads. I don't feel that I improve my language much, skipping to topics or levels you would like to try its nearly impossible, tho whole level feels extremely easy, but misstakes are counted to their very specific way of translating the sentences, its very inflexible and not smart at all. Stakes system is horrible. No regular updates or improvements. And much more..."
"the new interface is really limiting and feels counterintuitive to language learning. it's not a linear process and the new structure is painful to use edited to add, I still feel this way, and with the new structure it's even harder, especially in the writing/learn hanzi part. the second character it has you learn Âíñ has so many strokes"
"Pros: gamified element+ repetition makes it easier to learn a lot of vocab words. Cons: everything else. After a certain point I had to go to another app to learn actual grammar because Duo doesn't break the gaming to explain anything & assumes you'll just figure it out. Early on you can, further in no. But I had enough sunk cost by then to succeed beyond Duo. Also I'm good with freemium either giving me ads or hounding me to upgrade, but they do BOTH exhaustively and it gets REALLY OLD FAST."
"it would be good to be told the rules as you go along. There used to be some help guidance but that that seems to have been removed. And also it would be nice to have an adult's version rather than teenager. Duolingo talks too much about things like teeth braces, exams, what clothes go with each other and so on. Not really very useful for adult conversation. Oh and it's very American. You have to learn two languages as you go along! I've slowly reduced my score because of these things."
"Well, it's certainly helped me with German and Japanese, though one thing that's always confused me is in the puzzle translations it's always wanted a proper English translation instead of it's direct meaning, and the lack of language immersion really makes it quite a bit more difficult to learn a foreign language."
I have loved this app it is so easy too use and it teaches you so quickly. You should definitely try itü•≥. Previously I thought that an update made it harder to use but I enjoy using it a lot more now. However I am annoyed that maths and music courses on Duolingo aren't available for android at least that is how it is for me.
"Got the option for a 14 day trial of duolingo super. Duolingo promised they would notify me 2 days before the trial ended, in case I decides to cancel. I never received the notification about the trial ending. None of the emails I received recently had anything to do with it. I cancelled super the same day I was charged, and was told I wouldn't be refunded. I attempted to reach out to their customer support via email, but haven't received a reply."
"Duolingo is a great app if youre looking to learn a new language. The art style is so cute and neat, as well as the format. However, patience is key. People say you never learn anything you'll actually use, but that's not true. You just need to learn the basics first! (dont miss a day... keep an eye on your friends and family guys...)"
"Duoling once was good. It lacked on explanations of gramatical concepts but filled the need for a practicing tool well. Unfortunately it has consecutively been changing to the worse. About a year ago they took away the ability to pick your own lessons and now you are forced to do endless senseless repetitions. Using it now is like a painful grind to fulfull their gamified goals, it's absolutely demotivating."
"Have been using this app for more than a year. Really appreciate being encouraged in the daily lesson(s) habit. It has dramatically improved my vocabulary, but not often my ability to understand local native speakers, at least not yet. I usually ask them to repeat slowly. I speak a little, haltingly. Glad to have the app and keep trying. I wish it automatically included the noun's gender when introducing the new word and reinforced noun gender more often in the practices. Fun way to learn."
"Good App, but plenty adverts unless you pay for upgrade, and occasionally hangs/ crashes on my s20. Edit: 100 days in, and generally happy but the app remains a bit glitchy, occasionally doesn't start up/ load correctly. Edit: 180 days in it started being a crashy mess again. Keep having to ""Force Stop"" to get it to load properly. Also, the Americanisms are getting a tad irritating. Wish they did a UK English version!"
"Unfair system, making you buy more. I have been a fan of Duolingo for years now and have made progress on learning different languages. Just recently I have bought my premium. I find it frustrating that the app would freeze on me from time to time. Especially during the time I have a Double XP on. After finishing a lesson, specifically during the listening game. I did it twice and have froze on calculating."
"The English translations are just odd and don't make a lot of sense. The rewards also disappear when you move them into the shop. I'm still quite fond of the old design, it was way more user friendly, now everything's confusing. Still a good tool to practice you languages, but not a learning tool whatsoever."
"1. No rules and errors are explained - think for yourself why there is an error here. Extremely infuriates. 2. No drag&drop on Android (but available on iOS). Extremely annoying. 3. Wrong hints - use it and lose your hearts. 4. Animation is good, but excessive and too long, impossible to skip. 5. Sometimes they disable hints on keyboard (predictive text input). Without any explanation."
"It's really helpful when wanting to learn a specific language, and can be very addictive. I would suggest Super Duolingo, but if you don't have the money, it's not needed. They also really do award you, for me, at the end of a unit I got 3 days of Super Duolingo for free."
"Overall, the app is great! My only complaint, so far, is the font they use is confusing, at times. The capital ""I"" looks the same as the lower case ""l"" (just like right here). When I'm trying to learn words I don't know and they switch between upper case and lower case letters, I can't tell if they're using the i/I or the l/L, causing me to answer incorrectly."
"There are a lot of glitches with streaks and the freezes for them, but the app is easy to use and enjoyable except for that. Edit, I'd also like it if I could undo leaderboard league ""fixes"" or at least that there was a check in there. I'm the kind of person who doesn't like leaderboards to begin with and now I'm out 2,000 gems."
"Sadly I have not enjoyed the latest updates that have been rolled out. Specifically, I am finding the themed units (like ""tell spooky stories"" etc) to be repetitive and less useful than the seemingly more grammar-driven track I was on before. Since the update I also keep getting introduced to vocab I already know as if it's new! And the ""weak words"" personalized practice keeps giving me the exact same six words, which is super annoying and boring. Idk what happened but it used to be much better!"
"Seems like it would be useful if you are going into a language with zero experience, but I had a lot of Spanish in school, my vocabulary is poor, but my grammar is good. I'm stuck going through early portions, they have a way to skip ahead, but it requires you to write sentences with difficult vocabulary, so I'll go through most of the test with zero mistakes, and then fail at the last few questions because they use a word I don't remember"
It's a really good way to step into another language. I like the pronunciation practice element as it helps to build your confidence in this new language. The app does have errors in my case in Mandarin a question may contain the correct Hanzi character but the wrong pinyin while the audio says the hanzi. If you know the hanzi you can complete the task without getting it wrong but especially in a timed challenge it can be annoying. That being said it is a good language learning app.
"It's a great learning app for languages, it's fun and all but it lost one star from me because I remember that a few years ago you could buy costumes for Duo (the owl) and I loved that but for some reason they removed that feature and I am really sad because of it. Duolingo PLEASE bring back the costumes, they were so much fun!!!! :)"
"Cool app to practice some language skills and build basic confidence. I wish I could rate it higher, but at this point the app is more a mobile game rather than a language learning assistant. I really miss some features like: - Ability to build your own dictionary. Ideally with integration for adding new words to the list - More explicit topics for theory and practice - ""Forgetting curve"" reflection to optimize the learning process - I also really want to see the Serbian language in the list"
"The web interface and Android app should match, but they always show different quests. The Android app often freezes when opened the first time on a day, and has to be closed and reopened. The Spanish course should allow you to try lessons from different groups within a unit in whatever order you choose, but instead it forces you to go in a specific order."
"Sometimes consider something's wrong when it should be right. Loved all the 'game' vibes. I hate it when they do some updates, the gems needed for free users increase a lot (from 10 to 30 each). I'm not bothered by ads, but can you bring that back, please? I used to be top 3 in every league, now i don't even feel like keeping top 10 anymore üíî [edit] JUST GETTING STINGIER. gems lighting round required was originally 10, became 30, and now 50!? bye."
"This is the most amazing app. Normally Ads of apps runs you crazy. But I am even happy to click and read the Ads that this app shows at the end of each lesson to support them somehow. Furthermore, it is the greatest app ever. My goal was to learn another 1 Language. Now it has become another 3 languages for the next 4 years of my life. Thank you guys. The Karma of what have you done here will keep paying back to you. Many thanks"
Ok so this app is great for learning languages. But there is a certain limit to some things. For example the way they promote super duolingo I like they are promoting health awareness. Literally!!!! The amount of ads based on super duolingo is mad.....and the fact that this is a learning platform makes it even worse. After every single lesson there is a ad based on super duolingo. And I personally think that before teaching basic verbs there should be a teaching lesson.
"Updated review: There needs to be a confirmation box for timer boosts. When doing a timed exercise, I keep buying timer boosts my mistake because it's right in the spot where I'm typing. I'd like to cancel, but there's no option. It's causing me to lose blue gems. I don't like that. Great app. We need Wolof. I do wish there was a way to send messages to followers and more that we could use the blue jewels on. üëçüèªüëçüèºüëçüèΩüëçüèæ"
"Gamifying language learning is the best way to get someone to commit, return, and create a habit. While it doesn't contain all the things needed to fully learn a language, it's a great tool to have offered for free. Also, the widget tends to bug out and not update, making me lose my streak, which frustrates me. The widget is why I left this at 4 stars, with other minor nitpicks."
"Removing stars as they remove features... When the hell is Music coming to Android?? I'm about to drop this down to 3 stars... The most recent update changed it so Personalized Practice has the same icon as normal lessons now and that's just awful. It was fine before but now it looks and feels worse. It makes lessons look overwhelming with no breaks at a glance and it's hard to tell where each lesson is when you're reviewing. More bad updates, going down to 3 stars. 2 if this keeps up..."
"I'm already bilingual, and decided to learn a third language while practicing my second language. It offers a great balance for new learners and the ability to jump ahead to your current skill level. I seriously appreciate the pace. I do wish there was a French Canadian option since spoken French is different between the two but hopefully at a later date."
It's a good starter app. I do think it sometimes stays on the same few words a bit too long for me. It can give a false sense of progression if you are only reusing the same words because you'll think you memorized it now but it was obvious: you'll forget it (or mix it up) at a later time). I wish it learned to move on and return older words if you forgot it much later like Anki. Also wish I could disable the voice over on pressed words in same language voice to text quizzes for harder exposure.
"This app is very good! i've been learning more Filipino with the App however there is one problem whenever i have to say a sentence in English for example: ""We are Short"" whenever i have to do that it takes forever to load i've tried to fix it but it's not working please fix this problem Thank you. Overall rating - 9/10"
"Love this app. Forgivable manipulation and gamification at its best. Learned so much! But on my 20 day streak in Chinese, suddenly, 80% of the course content changed. I was demoted half a unit, and I'm told I've completed lessons for words I've never learned. I don't know who's daft idea it was to move the goal posts so far without a heads-up, but it's a jarring experience and makes me nervous to continue investing time in it. Better write down all the stuff I can remember so I don't lose it!"
"I think it's a great learning tool with multiple ways of picking up or refreshing a language. Two downsides that keep me from giving it a 5-star rating: the speaking feature never works on my phone (may be an Android thing), so I am unable to practice speaking, and I really don't appreciate that all the scenario stories have to be so woke."
"The app is really well made. I personally picked German to learn and the category of learning EDUCATION. It was having almost the same format of teaching as another language for which I had formal education. This goes to show how legitimate the app is. Though I am quite annoyed of the ads, I will not spend any kind of money on an app. But it is really nice that one can get the premium version for free by progressing (though occasionally)."
"Not great for conversational language learning. I don't really need to know how to say ""The crocodiles sent an email and built a sand castle..."" or whatever. I wish it spent more time explaining the grammar and how to be conversational. Teach me how to order food or ask for directions etc. It also sucks that you can't learn specific countries' versions of Spanish eg Puerto Rico, or Cuba, etc....because they're definitely pretty different from Spain Spanish."
"Hey everyone, I just wanted to share my experience with Duolingo. Unfortunately I was charged with 56‚Ç¨ on accident , I had a really frustrating time using their app. Not only did I encounter technical issues, but their customer support was unhelpful and didn't provide any solutions. It's disappointing when a language learning platform that promises so much falls short in delivering a quality experience. I hope they can improve their services in the future or atleast offer a different plan."
"I have been using duolingo to learn some languages for the past few months, and it's a superb free language learning app. The whole lesson is designed in an interesting way that promotes effective learning. There are few ads, but I don't mind them because duolingo is giving me more than it. Everything is great, but I really want Thai in this particular app because there are too few resources available for it. I love duolingo very much~‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®Ô∏è"
"Had a basic understanding of Spanish like he, she, hello and goodbye. The first few lessons were a breeze and it builds up your understanding slowly and definitely if you start at the beginning. It uses many different teaching techniques through the lessons so you get a good grip of how the language works. Pictures, sentences, fill in the blank, multiple choice. The best free app I've found. Also has other languages than Spanish! I get the same satisfaction as if I'm playing a mobile game. 5‚≠ê"
It's a decent app when you're just starting out. Mostly it's memorizing phrases and words. I don't love that you have to guess and do some deductive reasoning to figure out the grammar rules. It would be nice if there was a short grammar explanation for some of the lessons. I get a lot of lessons done perfectly because I have a great short term memory but I'm not sure how much this will help in the long run.
"It is a very helpful and motivates me to keep learning, lots of languages to choose from. Rewarding when you complete a lesson. If you want to learn a language, then you should get this app, and start learning for free! 4 Stars (and there's a bird, so thats cool)"
Removing the user comments was a huge mistake. They provided explanations and examples to correct mistakes. The app no longer does that leaving you with no meaningful way to understand your mistakes or improve. There is now no feedback to help you improve. Every update and change seems to make Duolingo worse. Duolingo was much better a few years ago.
It's not perfect but it's free. It sometimes makes mistakes and mixes up words like pen apple and house but only rarely. This is an excellent app for schools A teacher or a substitute teacher can teach any language without needing to know it. just assign the students to the appropriate classes assign them points to accumulate and let them go
"Changed the way to navigate. Chngd 4st 30 days using the app and really like how it made me want to practice. Of course still requires the student to take notes in order to remember vocabulary and caracters. 100+ days using the app: The layout of the lessons changed in a harder to review order. Before, I could see many lessons and their title in a quick glance. Now, the lessons are in buttons almost like in a candy crush game. Much harder to go back and forth when looking for previous lessons."
"The app is great and really does help me learn new languages. But why is my only subscription option on a 1 year term? Many of us today don't have $120 sitting around to spend on a service like this. That's money I need to dedicate to tangible things. I would seriously consider looking into monthly payment options. I would be fine paying monthly for 12 months, but it's too much to pay it all at once."
"Easy to use, and easy to fit into a busy life - you can do as much or as little as you want - and I'm slowly making progress in a new language. It can be a bit temperamental on speaking exercises. I'm also using it for a language I'd started learning previously, and I'm finding it not as useful for that as I'm not really learning anything new yet. I love the French podcast that is available too."
"Loved this app since it's early day and it keeps improving for the better. It would be nice for native speakers to sharpen up on their own language like English person learning English. Loving the math and music on iOS and excited for it to move across all platforms as well looking forward to future lessons. Also, to the developers, I really admire how you take your time to refine everything you bring out before adding additional languages etc üòäüíï"
"The app takes language acquisition from all directions- including speaking, writing and memorization. the characters are cute, microlearning is simple and fits easily into your day. I took 2 years of French in high school and I'm able to leverage that and refresh my memory while learning new things as well. My entire family uses this and we all love it."
"They took out all the conversations in the lessons and now you are expected to guess your way into learning. I use to love the app but now I'm looking for an alternative. If they aren't going to explain the wrong answers and give explanations for new content, then don't remove the community responses. We need a way to learn what we did wrong. Unfortunately, after 850 days on this app as a paid user, I'm looking for a different app that gives more explanation and has a better teaching format."
"It is very good and I love a competition to get up in the league. but I don't rate 5 stars because sometimes I can't hear the small letters in a sentence but you just need to slow it down and you'll be fine. And it's kinda annoying how you have to use double xp on the next 15 minutes, I wish you could save them for whenever."
"Okay, nice app. Nice way to teach a language, it's good and would work great if you're also learning outside of the app. What I don't like is the way they try to force me to buy the premium, like, there's no way to close the pop-up, either you try their free trial or just close the whole app, not nice Duolingoü•∫"
"I've used this app since 2018 which makes me feel old. It's incredible though and I'm currently studying Esperanto which is a constructed language that was meant to be used for diplomats, and as a secondary language to help in international communication. If you have a basic understanding of the European romance languages I'd most definitely look into it as it is a mesh of several."
"After the update today, the app is weird. It would spin 360 degree whenever I clicked from elsewhere back to home. It's making me dizzy... No vocabulary list, difficult to learn Indonesian with no word list. Not easy to learn korean also, app more suitable for european languages. Also, the app is buggy. I was supposed to get 2x points but often when I checked the total, i only got 1x the points. Does not correctly assign the rewards (gems and points) for having completed the quests and lessons."
"Update 02/07/23 Terrible delays, over 1 minute waiting before the exercise AND after. As I see it, Duolingo consists of two parts: language learning and challenges. For learning you don't need anything: no diamonds, time boosts, nothing. All paid features do not help learning any better or easier but they help with challenges and points. But while learning part is pretty good, the other part with challenges, earning xp points etc is very bad. So, ignore paid features and your ranking."
"Some days I love Duolingo. Then I remember that it's teaching relies heavily on a learner failing and I get demotivated. I'm British learning French but Duolingo forces American English on me, with sentences that are completely alien. There's a tool to report the anomalies but your efforts to report them are completely ignored. So I'm on the fence. Can I recommend it? If you like the brutality of motivation through demotivating then yes. Otherwise, stick to the free version and keep sane!"
"This app/game (üòâ) is perfect! It teaches you a new language in a fun and engaging way! You don't have to sit through lessons, you play a game and learn! Learning a language is proven to help you and this is a fun and easy way to do it. The original game is fine even without the premium. But if you want the premium is very affordable and makes it just a little better! I recommend to download this app/game (üòâ) to connect with people or just have fun. ü•≥üìò"
Duolingo is a great way for me to practice the languages I've learned and to stimulate daily revision. I find it especially useful for vocabulary as it uses the principle of repetition. I use the app to supplement in person classes as those still do better at establishing an understanding of grammar.
"I got the option to try super duolingo, and it said I would be notified before the trial ended and I would be billed, I wanted to cancel before that as I don't need the super version. However, I was never notified and was just billed, I tried getting a refund through Google immediately, but no luck so far, so I'm requesting a refund here now."
"Cute animation, although I wish Duolingo has put more effort into the content. I have paid for the full year of Ukrainian, but ran out of lessons in just one month. Poor selection of words and phrases, teaching me words that are the same in every language: file, Skype, business, jazz, and names such as Linda and Mark - over and over again. Ad nauseam! Emphasis is on the wrong syllable most of the time and no intonation whatsoever. No way to look up an antonym to a word. Sorry, do not recommend."
There is no feed back on how to speak the language or exactly why you're pronouncing it incorrectly. I would also like to see some syntax and/or grammar included or a reference section for WHY word order is the way it is and spellings are sometimes different for the exact same word. (G√†idhlig) It can be very frustrating. No one to have dialog or conversation with either. All I have learned is how to translate what I hear or see written. No closer to being able to speak than I was 3 months ago
"Its still good, however, one of the later choices has seriously diminished the experience. They ""simplified"" the lesson plan, letting you no longer choose which lessons you want to take and in what order. Instead youre forced to do exactly their path. This often forces me to do lessons in topics im already strong at, leading to a feeling that I am wasting my time, which made me stop using the app. I recommend one of its competitors, like babbel or coursera instead."
"Duolingo is a good vocabulary trainer, although it doesn't teach a lot of grammar and leaves you rather lost if you don't use supplementary material. However, I disagree with their decision to lay off linguist contractors in favor of AI, and so my rating is one star. Books at the library will do a better job of teaching real grammar, anyhow, and nothing beats speaking to someone who's native language is that which you're learning."
"Ain't that good. I'll be honest here because I've subscribed to the full-year paid version called ""Cringey Super Duolingo,"" and there are no additional features or something that could really help you improve your grammar. There aren't any AI or other features like what ""ELSA Speak"" offers. I really don't recommend this app to anyone who wants to learn seriously and dedicate themselves to a specific language. It's just for LAZY PEOPLE, and the PAID USERS also know that real bad. (Just dig on YT)"
"I like this app very much, it is by far the best free app for learning a foreign language if one is too busy for intensive classes, but in he whole of the Champion Section we've been repeating the same questions all over again, with very limited vocabulary. How many times can we repeat a sentence like:"" The demand for ducks with red coats had begun""???"
"Huge cash grab. You cannot learn correctly and efficiently unless you pay for the super duolingo subscription. Plus the hilariously repetitive ads make me want to shoot my phone. Also they're very clearly using AI as a crutch, but its not as smart as it ""thinks"" it is. The app will keep getting you to practice your ""weakest words"" when in reality they are simple words I've understood and haven't made an error on at all."
"love this app so much; totally addictive and fun. Having a hard time with conjugating, please add tables for past present and future; to see it all together helps a ton. Also, could you please add a list of all of the vocabulary for/from each section, and please maybe add more exercises where we have to type the answer in different ways, helps to engrain in the brain. Please add more tips and explanations of why and how to do things. Love all the ways it teaches you! Stellar app so far!‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Duolingo has vastly improved since I first tried it in 2017. The adaptive learning is awesome because it pushes you at your own pace, if you're learning quick it gets difficult quick. I've been doing a new language for a month and I'm definitely sticking with it this time."
"Update: I'm getting sick and tired of the ""we've syned the app for new and improved lessons"" I've been put back multiple lessons 6x now! I'm beyond frustrated üò† I don't even bother trying to do anything but one lesson a day anymore because if I do several and have my progress regressed I'll lose my mind. i can definitely read in Spanish speaking is still hard but can understand conversations mostly. legendary status shouldn't cost so many gems though like dang 50 is enough"
"I started using this application to improve my Japanese listening skills. At some point, the audio starts teaching the wrong pronounciation, it got to a point every day I ask my Japanese wife if the audio I is correct or wrong. And I started worrying about practice which make permanent of mistakes. There is a report button, but no response for your feedback, and when no way of indicating if it's the sentence or the words (sometimes audio mismatch)."
"Great language learning app overall! Just one small bug I really hope gets fixed: After viewing another user's profile page, pressing the ""back"" button on the top corner of the screen will make your entire screen, I kid you not, SPIN and then your previous screen pops up. This clearly wasn't intended, so please try to fix it as it is quite annoying. I am on an Android device. Thank you so much!"
"App is buggy. Pressing near an answer will select wherever the app can reasonably reject a correct answer, to try and hawk the paid version. No easily accessible way to extend streaks or purchase streak freezes, as the store controls were eliminated in the previous update. Used to love this app, but it's all just a cash grab now. *Edit* has only gotten worse, ads now show up whenever time is important, forcing purchases. Absolutely abysmal. Something so good traded for greed. :("
"That new achievement was never available on all phones, the updates I done on the app have not really done anything, there was supposed to be updates on the badge system and nothing, when I do missions there's times it doesn't even count and have to do it again. Lots of users are going up the ranks in the tournament in a matter of seconds. I send multiple emails on this to Duolingo and feels like I'm just getting ignored. I got super Duoligo and feels like a big waste of money and time. üëéüèª"
"This app's quality has gone down significantly in the last yr. U can no longer use custom profile images and have to use these ugly asf characters, and it is constantly pushing the paid version. They took features that were originally free and hid it behind a paywall, if u make a mistake, u lose a life, and you have to restart if u run out and u can no longer choose what lesson to do next, it's extremely linear, and overall just sucks. It's sad to see another app makin ppl pay 4 the bare minimum"
"great for learning vocabulary, but the ""game"" design is very boring and poorly executed. gems have no purpose, and once you have achieved the top league once, there is no point to keep competing in the weekly ladders. once you've ""beaten the game"" you're just in it to maintain your streak, at which point it doesn't matter how much you practice. the quests and currency need to be better fleshed out, and there need to be more rewards. streak freezes and 2x xp just don't cut it."
"Good app to practice some basic foreign languages, but it's no substitute for immersion. This app pulls you into competition with other users which I do not like. There is also little explanation of rules, and you are left to figure that out on your own. The games are fun, though, and it's an interesting way to learn a new language."
"I used to absolutely love this app...not so much now though. As others have said, it does not really cover structure or rules of grammar that would help you to learn better. Also, the older format was ALOT better. I do not like the new format at all. It makes it much harder to earn points for the league and has a lot of woke agendas thrown in...forget politics just help me learn!!!"
"I have really enjoyed using this app and am currently just over a 300 day streak. The only thing I can complain about is that the monthly quest meter doesn't seem to be working properly. I missed January's badge after doing plenty more exercises than it said I did. Now for February, I've been doing 2-3 lessons each day and as of Feb 9, it's showing I've only done 4 quests. I'm not sure what isn't working properly to count my lessons, but I'd appreciate if that could be reviewed and fixed."
"The tasks are good, it helps with all aspects in learning the language, and the tips for the entire section are really helpful. The only thing that makes it really hard is the number of hearts, 5 hearts is a little too less, and maybe 15 hearts would be better. I mean, the higher I go, the harder the units get, my 5 hearts finish up really quickly and I can't reach my goals, I think 15 is reasonable so people can reach their goals a bit quicker."
"Great app to learn language and it is completely free if you can bear through ads. The app gamifies learning process that can make it entertaining. The constant notification can be annoying, but it does force you to learn. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 since I found that it does not detect accent well during the speaking part and penalizes me unnecessarily sometimes."
"It starts great. Pictures to learn the words, builds up sentences etc. The further into it, that goes away, and it just gives you different ways to say things with no reason as to the changes to help you understand. Must admit, I'm lost now, so have lost interest as I know what to say, but no idea of the right way to apply it."
"Generally fun, but they provide no support for bugs and the vocab review feature is basically non existent. After two months of studying Russian, it says I've been introduced to ~400 words. Yet if I use the ""review your words"" feature, it only shows me the same ~10 words. I've completed an entire new section, yet it won't let me review any new words, which is really infuriating. I reported this problem, but of course it's been ignored. I'll revise my rating if this is ever fixed."
"Im slowly learning the language as is the intention, but for some reason every now and then the audio gets wierd. Sometimes its fine, others time the questions change between quiet and loud. I can max my volume and barely hear it, then the next question works fine so it blasts my ears. Its not every day but when it happens it messes with me more than it should."
"I've been a user for a decade. This is the worst version of Duolingo ever. Lighting rounds don't give xp. So many bugs in exercises. Japanese kana exercises don't count as lessons. I'm so tired of the low quality product forced down our throats these days. Soulless products like this, that used to be so inspiring and groundbreaking. It feels like a dead robot repeating the same sentence and smiling at you with no expression in the eyes."
"While I'm ok with some ads to support a free app, it's NOT OK üö´ when ads have tiny close button impossible to hit. I just tried to close one ad 4 times but instead kept paying someone with my clicks... Frustrating customers will steer people to other options, NOT handover a paid subscription to your ""premium"" services."
"Used to be a good app, but they've expanded the engine so much that now it constantly crashes unless you have one of the latest devices. I'm in the top 0.1% of users, but I'm about ready to quit. I have to restart the app after every lesson. Granted, it's free and a good way to become familiar with a language, but it's easy to fall prey to their participation contests. Paying customers have huge advantages. If it works for you, focus on the learning alone. I've been doing Duolingo for 5 years."
"If you are beyond very basic level, the app doesn't teach anything. Its only good to practice the knowledge you gained elsewhere. Even though, if the app thinks you answer the question wrong, in majority of cases it doesn't explain why it was wrong, so again, no teaching here. Also the same questions are being repeated from class to class and from level to level. I only use it for practice the grammar, but learn Spanish using other sources."
"It is free, actuallyteaches you a language, and works with any schedule. I like that it has very different types of questions (some are matching words to pictures, some are write what you hear, some are translate this phrase, fill in the blanks, speak the phrase... and more). And each tiny lesson mixes the types of questions so that it doesn't get boring. To me it feels like a game, but to my husband it feels like homework; so while I absolutely love Duolingo, it isn't for everyone."
"I love the app, everything is excellent except there isn't any explanation of grammer in the context it's being used and why. So if you make a mistake it basically won't tell you what the proper word is and what it is that makes it proper. This makes basic gendered words in dutch a nightmare to learn without lots of trial and error."
"Wish there was a setting that would allow me to turn off the writing exercises. My ability to even spell words in my own language kind of sucks, I feel like the writing is holding me back from learning another language. Please developers add a way to turn off the writing exercises if the user desires too. Wouldn't think that could be too difficult."
"Really like the app and I feel like I'm learning quite abit of Spanish... what I don't really like is how long I have to wait to get 5 hearts again when not using the paid version, but you can use the practice option to gain hearts which is a great feature. Also, there used to a chat/comment option for each phrase and each lesson. Sometimes it can get confusing and there are sometimes more than one way to translate something. I thought it was useful to talk with other users about it."
"Great way for casual language learning if trying to pick up on a language without necessarily setting aside too much time and effort in the run of a day. Used this in conjunction with a few other resources for learning Japanese, and while I wouldn't say I had any massive degree of fluency, when I enrolled in a Japanese course in university, whereas many had great difficulty, I found the essentials which Duolingo assisted with, gave me a strong leg up. Would appreciate seeing family again."
"Love the app. You can learn at your own pace. There are goals to achieve at a steady pace to keep you from over saturating the learning. It keeps a record of what you are stuggling with, which makes it more personalised. I also love the leader board, which keeps you motivated to keep going. If you have been putting off learning a lesson, this is a great way to begin that journey! I would give 10 stars if it was available."
"In this app's early years, it was focused on learning, with stories to practice and many tries at multiple tiered challenges. Now, those same challenges as Rapid review have been sliced up, locked behind extremely fast timers that mostly push you to buy Super or gems to proceed. Leagues were added that pressure you to memorize only parts of words to efficiently make sentences, gain XP, and reach Diamond, seriously damaging your retention of words. Other apps are more thorough and less gamified"
"The Duo app is very engaging and easy to use with bite-sized lessons. Your quests depend on how much time you spend on the app,so it's never too difficult to finish. And you can learn multiple languages at once. However,some African languages on here would be nice too. As well as lessons on interchangeable words (such as using proper prepositions with expressions)"
"I really enjoy this app. The exercises cover listening, speaking, reading and writing in your chosen study-language. The tasks are short and varied with many different voices used to speak in their 1st language, to help you assimilate the reality of the language. You are encouraged to repeat and correct, the activities that you made mistakes in. The app tracks common errors that you make in both spelling and punctuation of your selected new language."
"I've had Duolingo for a few years now. Unfortunately, I lost all my phone data and, with it, the password to get in. Their system does not work properly. I've tried to reach out to Duolingo countless times, and no one has helped me. I paid a subscription, and I can not even use it. I requested a refund, denied. Worst customer service. I wish they cared for the app users much more."
"The Avatar should not be the only option for a profile photo. I don't like the look of the avatars, and just prefer having an actual photo. Make it an option for people to choose between one or the other. I've also noticed that the Android version of the app is less responsive then the iOS version. I have a newer phone that works well with most other apps, so I know my phone model is not the issue."
"Update: Crashes when opened now. I hardly want to do it daily anymore, it is so tedious. Every time there is a major update and ""restructure"" the ""paths,"" I get a bunch of stuff I haven't actually learned yet. I'm just expected to know it. What? The point is for this app to teach me a new language well, it fails. Often, the sentence structure is so off, it makes no sense to a native English speaker learning a new language. Just put the English sentence in the same structure as what I'm learning."
"Nice and interesting ways to learn new languages or improve on one you already speak. Though if not on the Super version, the ads make it rather annoying....but hey, they've got to pay bills, so that's the price one needs to pay for free stuff üòâ üòú üòÄ"
"it's more a memory app than a teaching app. it doesn't actually teach you anything about language. it's always contradicting itself by repeatedly showing you one way, then marking you wrong with no explanation when you answer that way it uses sentences that don't make sense and makes it even more confusing to learn. my cat wanting to work at a grocery store doesn't make sense. I'm at a 90 day streak and it's still using day one words... i know what a pen is already give me some new words"
"So pleased to see you have reinstated the learning grammar notes for each topic/level. Much more helpful again thank you! However all my legendary levels have disappeared this and the trail is completely different! What has happened? Love this app but would like my legendary levels reinstated please. (I've now abandoned doing legendary levels, I've had them removed once before and won't risk it a third time.)"
"It helps me because i tend to race through without paying attention to everything. The constant repetition makes me aware to what i am not paying attention. It makes me listen, read, write. I have tried other apps. This format is the best for Korean because the sounds and characters are so similar. You are not learning conversational Korean just to get by. You are learning to write, read the letters and to understand the differences in how we make sounds."
The best language app I've ever tried but I can't give 5 stars because the speaking exercises don't work. I turned on the microphone and gave all the permissions but it still doesn't help. I really lack pinyin in guidebook section. The characters are not helpful for me to write the phrases and read them to remember better. And one more feature that would make this app perfect is flashcards tool. That would be so much helpful to make the words memorizing and reviewing easier.
I like Duolingo a lot it helps with learning new languages but while making you feel like it's a game. Duolingo finds fun and challenging ways to help you with the language you are trying to learn. It also reviews any mistakes you made throughout the lesson you are on. The only thing I have against is how they word things the way they word things quite challenging to figure out I was stuck on a lesson because they expected me to know that I needed to split up the word. Overall I like Duolingo.
"It's a really good app. I hope they can diversify the Vietnamese program they have. They only focus on the Northern accent. If they could split it between North and South, that would be helpful. I also think there should be more speaking practice opportunities to really target pronunciation in a language with such intricate phonology. As a Korean learner of 10 years, I must say the Korean program is extremely difficult and needs improvement."
"Great app for learning foreign languages and has lots of fun and varied learning techniques, like stories and speaking experiences (unfortunately theys aren't available on certain languages). The only problem is that it doesn't focus on grammar much so you probably couldn't learn to speak a language fluently just using Duolingo. But overall it is a great app!"
"There are no options on the app to point out errors. Most of which are only the mispronounciation by the automated voices. Also, some of the story lines are not necessarily appealing to a general audience. Too many repititions become tedious. Some sentences are humourous but so unrealistic as they will never be used in any context. However, the app is a very helpful tool and somewhat addictive. But it is best used with other learning material. Some explanations of grammatical points are missing."
"Been using it for a year now, pretty good app apart from the new update that made all profile pictures have an ""avatar"" instead of a picture. Doesn't let you change back to a picture/image file even if you go on the website instead of the app. I personally don't like this update, I don't want to display how I look, I want to show pictures of my cat etc"
"Excellent resource for the self-motivated learner. If you actively wish to learn a new language, you can really make this app work for you if you take it upon yourself to make it a rule that you speak out loud to the best of you ability at every opportunity, as the app is not able to focus on spoken exercises. In leu of this, I really wish there were auditory-only exercises that forced you to listen to a sentence in the foreign language, which you then have to type out the translation of."
"Single units have become ridiculously long, with 20+ exercises. Also, IOS has always had many more kinds of exercises compared to Android. Maybe after a couple of years it would also be time to expand Android's questions and whatnot? It is so boring to do always the same 3 exercises and sentences, repeated over and over. Not a very effective way of learning."
"Here's my review for Duolingo: In my experience with using it I have found it to be quite a useful app. First impressions were five stars and it is still true. Very easy to use, good interface. And the characters are really fun. And no you will not be attacked by Duolingo like the Internet says. I am currently learning German and I can now pronounce many sentences. Great app!"
"It used to feel like the app was earnestly trying to teach you a language, but after recent updates I feel like they're just trying to run down my hearts with repetitive, boring lessons. I stopped learning and now just repeat the same 3 sentences in different variations. Losing hearts because I'm bored and not paying, not because I don't know the answer..."
"Honestly, this app is great and I have been trying to learn Arabic since its my original language in my free time. But I decided to switch to Korean, since I wanted to learn too. I closed the app and came back in a bit, and I came across this bug that wouldn't let me open duolingo... I try to open duolingo, but it just closes the app. I tried to delete duolingo and redownload. It worked for a bit, but the bug came back. Hopefully this bug gets fixed :D"
"‰Ω†Â•Ω! I'm learning mandarin! The only gripe I have is that if the course content changes, IE: Unit 2 now talks about music and lawyers, and you go back to do the review tests for the stars, it does not bridge the gap by introducing the new words. It just expects you to know them. At higher level, it is riddled with people that auto complete lessons for leaderboards. Why though.... I would love to help the developers prevent this."
Love the learning experience and the lessons are really good at teaching vocabulary and entering into long term memory. It has boosted my confidence in speaking a different language to native speakers. Only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is because the match madness exercises are purely made to make money off the user. It's virtually impossible to complete a level 2 or 3 match madness without purchasing a row blaster or a time extension. Everything else is fantastic!
Very engaging. I am quite impressed. Using Spanish for over a month now and I have a decent base of knowledge. Occassionally will give you a reason why a certain format of a word is used versus another. I'm usually pretty accurate but if I know the philosophy behind it I will understand and learn it better. There have been once or thrice I felt it was incorrect and a few times it already had the answer selected and you couldn't click and other small glitches. A little intro would be nice too.
"This app while useful is so buggy that it is frustrating. The amount of times you say things correctly and it flags as incorrect is incredible. To a point that during some of the talking exercises I feel like giving up. The leagues are pointless, people shouldn't feel guilty because they haven't managed to find time to use the app on any particular day. This app would be loads better with a ""conversational"" setting, I'm not going to be talking about a butterfly writing a book at any point."
Is worth it but half the time any answer you put will either not be selected or the app will not mark it as correct. The more language corces you do the slower the app runs and it won't always start on the language you changed it to. The app doesn't teach you the grammatical system in a way that you learn and requires you to have enough intellect to figure out the languages grammatical system on your own.
"I've been using Duolingo for over five years. The most recent thing that has been happening is that I will do a lesson or two and when I log in the next day, I'll get a notification saying that they ""updated course content,"" it will start me over in that lesson. It will be the same exact content and lesson I did the day prior. I can't make any progress because each day it sets me back to lessons I've already done. Very frustrating. I've stayed with it so long and I hate to cancel it over this."
"Great app however alot of the writing requires you to translate a sentence from eg Spanish to english instead of the opposite which would be just as if not more beneficial for learning a language. Also the notes for each level don't have a lot of explanation for why they use or change the form of something etc. Instead it's very basic & that could easily be expanded eg a table showing how a word changes form. Aside from those, really great app and highly recommend-my Spanish has improved hugely!"
"Duolingo is a very effective and engaging learning aid when used in conjunction with separate learning resources. It is a useful tool for getting to grips with pronunciation and spelling, but perhaps falls a little short on explaining grammar concepts in my experience. Would still recommend for anybody new to or even experienced in learning a second language."
"Very disappointing for a paid service. I miss the message boards that allowed learners to interact and learn more about a topic. App will frequently be glitchy and not register that I played on a day forcing me to use a ""streak freeze"". The devs keep updating the leaderboard/ app and not really saying anything to the users (just ""surprise!""). I want to pay for another year, but their inconsistencies are pushing me away."
"The app is undeniably good. When learning languages, it takes you through the very basics, repeating the material so many times that you easily perceive and remember it. As a result, you begin to understand native speakers, compose quite complex sentences and express your thoughts professionally. There are also a large number of quality courses to choose from. Thanks to the Duo team üíöüíöüíö"
"This is a good app that makes learning a language fun, and I feel I have come on quite far in the six months I have been using it. My major criticism centres around glitching points system. It says I will get double points then doesn't give them, or says I will get higher points on a level up but just gives regular points. And I have recently discovered that my friend who has the app on her iPad gets more than double the points I can for the same lesson. üò§ Not fair when we compete in leagues."
"I take back my word on saying it's a good app and instead of the former 4 stars, I'm giving it 1 star, I'd have given 0 star if it were possible. Even after updating it repeatedly, it keeps telling me I'm offline and as if that's not bad enough, it keeps closing repeatedly whenever I'm in the middle of a class and I can't reopen it no matter how many times I try. This is really disappointing. This is not the Duolingo I know and grew to love."
"App is good at teaching you a language at a very basic level. If you want any advanced learning without interruptions, you need to pay but even then the developers over the years have made sure to notify you at every possible instance to make you pay them even with subscription. Every exercise is aimed at making you spend as much app time as possible while promoting you to pay for stuff to reduce frustrations while learning. App has been around for several years but still has plenty errors."
"I'm just learning spanish for fun, but it's very cool to fo with this app. only one thing i noticed: when you need to translate a sentence from English to Spanish, you can't tell if the ""you"" is singular or plural, so would be great if you did some kind of markers to make it clearer! edit: also would love to have the option to turn off the vibration!"
"I have been using duolingo to learn German as a native English speaker. I had been paying for and trying other methods of learning German for over a year with little success. But, after just 18 free days Duolingo has taught me over 200 words. Their multi-faceted approach has helped tremendously as does the fact that their lessons are relatively short allowing for someone who has a busy schedule to still feel accomplishment."
"I really wish there was a non alcohol option for the food lessons...as a recovering alcoholic these set of classes is very very challenging for me. I put off my lessons cos I have to discuss beer and wine etc. not a good experience. other than that I mostly love the app, free is a bit repetitive but I manage."
"What I've noticed about this app it's really not up to date on an actual translation especially their Greek, I've actually looked in the Google Translation and a lot of their translations are far different than the duolingo. Duolingo needs to get more real world language that is actually spoken so they get an idea of actually the words and translations and they need to make their app more of a learning app than like a game. Their sentences aren't actually used in the real world"
"For the most part it's okay. I never had any issues up until yesterday/today when I noticed that with some of the Spanish exercises they are blatantly pronouncing the INCORRECT answer. Thought it was me at first, had to hit ""repeat"" multiple times just to be sure. Holding the speaker right next to my ear and listening at slower speeds is when I confirmed that it was in fact the wrong answer being pronounced."
"I'm giving this app a 4 star review because they don't include learning the alphabet of different languages in their guide book. I think this is important in order to be able to pronounce the sentences/words you are asked to interpret. For some languages, they may have letters that are not in the English language or they may resemble a letter in English but pronounced differently. Please I request that you add learning of the alphabet for each language(if it has alphabet)."
Very goood. It takes me step by step and is very interactive. Cartoonated but interactive. Allows all ages to find peace and comfort in it. I already feel like I can travel to Spain üòÇüòÇ. Though slow sometimes. especially when translating voices that you speak. It is like a Second or two behind and captures last words. Meaning you resay. But still ü•∞üî•üî•üî•üî•
Duolingo is one of the best ways to learn a language! it's great how it challenges you by using day streaks of how long you have been learning. It's a good idea to start from scratch even if you know some of the language unlike most language learning apps Duolingo has a strong basic curriculum of different units and subjects if you use Duolingo you will definitely notice your learning Improve over very short amounts of time! GET THIS APP YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!
"Generally good app for learning, I've been using it for 2+ years. But I have daily frustrations. I'm using Android, Ipad, browser, all 3 are vastly different experiences. Feels like they don't care abt providing a consistent experience. ie: dbl XP gift for Friend Quest challenge & will just disappear on the website. & seems like translations are AI generated, which doesnt work for cultural translations. I'm constantly reporting errors, which feels like I'm doing their job"
Great way to learn. Tries to figure out a good place to start you from. Good repetition for practice. Includes both Hiragana and Kanji recognition with reading practice as well. Sets number of days challenge streaks to motivate daily visiting. You choose and set a realistic daily time period you can commit yourself too.
"it's a very nice app and a must recommend for those wishing to learn any language. However, there are times I find it difficult to access the app despity data being on. I'd suggest that a refresh function key be incorporated into the app. That way, one can refresh the app in cases of network glitch. Besides that, the app is all good."
"This is a decent app to learn a couple of semesters; however, it is lacking. This app shows you new words that you are tasked to memorize, and then it throws phases/sentences at you to memorize. The problem is that it never gives you what I would call a lesson. It never just tells you what the rules of the language are or the grammar. You have to figure these details out from the sentences you have to memorize. This is okay in the beginning, but it gets to a point where I find it untenable."
"Fun way to learn, recommended. It's more challenging in the free version, but you can definitely use this app to practice for a new language you may be learning. Explains basic pronunciation and writing skills, but not much information about grammar. But for using the app for just 2 weeks I can recognize some dialogs in real life and words sound more familiar. Give it a try!"
"Beware of super charges. I tried the super option and really like it! It really is helpful practicing every day. When I signed up for the trial it advertised it as $6.99 a mo. When the day for the trial ended I really did think that the app ad free was worth $6.99 so I didn't cancel, however it charged me $90 for an entire year. I would give 5 stars if there was better payment options. Being charged all up front sucks I would much rather pay a monthly subscription."
"The app presence and supporting characters are cute. I like the options to redo errors. The spatial repetition with streak freezes give good motivation. Only con is when I tapped on the Welsh words (the language I chose) it immediately shows the English equivalent in the Dropbox below the words. To me, that's like giving away the answer. If the learner can see the answer, there's no point in saying it afterwards. Remove this feature only, then it'll be a mighty fine program."
"Was enjoying it but something has changed recently. When you run out of hearts and practice to earn hearts, the exercises used to be varied and random. For the past few days it's been just largely the same phrases over and over again!!! I used to find it helpful to have to revisit long forgotten lessons but it's got too repetitive now. Please fix this as soon as possible."
"I love this app! I'm learning Italian, and I find it very engaging; you can have friends, weekly challenges, daily & monthly quests, badges etc able to go back and revise previous sections... The coding guys have a kinda quirky sense of humour that they bring out through the various characters in the lessons. Then there are these passive-aggressive reminders that they send as notifications... lol! Generally, it's a really good app for anyone who wants to learn any language from scratch!"
"I really enjoy the exercises. I am currently studying mandarin and unlike what most people thunk it is very easy, thanks to duolingo. I just miss the stories that used to be an option. I have been told they were now part of the course journey but I've still not seen a story during my 684 day streak. I'll keep going though."
"it is fantastic for practice. However, often it seems to glitch back in time to repeating old stuff you are well beyond. Additionally, new learning or grammar and word or sentence construction is very badly explained, or not at all. I have extra lessons, research and books to supplement the learning, and use duo for daily revision"
It is such a useful app. We could even jump to next levels with out completing the previous levels. But there are tests to check weather we are capable for that.This is completely free and is the best app for beginners.Have fun learning.For experts or averagely knowing about a particular language can write a test and directly jump to the next levels.For me this is the best free app I had ever downloaded. ‚ò∫üòä
"it's a great app but It makes me feel like I'm being thrown into water and, I'll either swim or drown. I'm rewarded the knowledge of my language by correcting what feels like my mistakes. Also there is no way to communicate with people in my class. And nobody advanced with me even though we should have all graduated and ran into each other."
"So I have been hacking away at Brazilian for a while. I call it Brazilian since Portuguese people can't converse with Brazilians. Any who, I have had a lot of life interruptions so I don't get to always practice and I have had long gaps in between lessons, but here's the thing, I retain the lessons and I now I can understand actual conversations."
Update 3/29/24 Really don't like the new update! Things are pretty good for the moment but there are some issues that usually arise when an update rolls around. It usually gets fixed after a couple weeks but that can be annoying. All in all I am learning alot in Spanish but when I go to other languages it is too tough for me to understand without any basic understanding of letters/characters and sentence structure. Maybe one day I'll try to figure them out but for now I love learning spanish.
"Great for motivation. A little concerned I might be learning to duolingo more than I am learning another language, the sentences repeat and can be predictable. a major improvement would be if we could make the sound effects quieter than the speech. currently it feels rude to practice in public due to the noise."
I thougt it was cool but I was mistaken all the features you want to have cost 6.99 a month for ONE person. You can't have it that personalized and if you do...it cost 6.99 a month. You want to work on something your not good at to train...6.99 a month. Also having the lives thing is stupid it takes away from learning and makes you mad if you lose a life. Also if you want infinite lives...6.99 a month. It is ok to learn some of a language but this just isn't it. I think I'll switch to bable.
"It's UI is nice and easy to understand, and I'm sue It's great for someone just visiting a country for a week, but as someone who wants to gain a a fundemental understanding of the language it just isn't for me. It meerly teaches you words and sentences rather than grammar and word structure. Good luck learning words on your own, because it does not give you the tools to do so. For anyone who's wondering, I've been learning German on an 11 day streak with around 20 lessons complete."
"Duolingo is the best app to learn new language but the reason I gave such a rating is because last time when I reached a peak of my streaks and targets but something went wrong with the app and I lost all my achievements and came back to zero. Suddenly I don't know what happened to the app on my phone, it was working very well on my other family members. But it is actually the best app to learn a new language."
Amazing!! I've learnt so much and Duolingo makes me motivated to keep going. Would definitely recommend it and wether you're using it for school or work or just for fun it is a fantastic online teacher. My friend had it and recommended it and it has changed my life. I am doing a language to help communicate with family and thanks to this app I can finally understand them. I hope you get this app and enjoy learning the language of your choice. Bye
"I'm learning Japanese. However, ""Practice your words"" doesn't work and neither do ""speaking exercises"". What's the point of paying when features don't work. üòë They don't even work on the PC. It's nice for encouragement and practice. But not learning in a proper way. Like it doesn't state which its formal or not to say something. I want to like it because of the easy interface, but it's ok for in-between lessons."
"great ap. it would be better if there was much more talking to the microphone segment and some AI integration for conversation. great ap but could be better. I also would prefer if you could chose to opt out of the written segments. personally I only have interest in learning to converse in other languages, I'm not interested in learning the written parts but they seem embed into the rest of the lesson progressions. change this to get an extra star :p"
"Fun lessons and very encouraging. As a native 'British' English speaker I have to filter translations through my understanding of 'American' English though (ON the weekend instead of AT the weekend, for instance) or get marked as wrong. Guess I'm getting lessons in two languages for the price of one there :). Well worth paying for Super Duolingo - I'm making much better progress now I have it. Thanks for the humour, Duo!"
"Useful app to start learning the basics of a language. I like the fact that there are listening, reading, writing, and speaking exercises. There are multiple units for different life contexts. The ads in the free version aren't very annoying, and every once in a while I get awarded Super Duolingo for free for a few days."
"Cant speak in app. I try but when i click the speak button it just closes after second with message ""taht doesn't sounds right""...even though i didnt even get to say anything. It keeps me failing. I was at russian course. Without account. Oh and i think when learning new languages with other alphabet than usual one Duolingo should teach you it to. Or else its confusing and hard."
I'm multilingual using Duo to learn Korean from scratch. Effective language learning tool if you allow yourself to follow the gaming approach. An improvement would be to allow a separate sound control for the milestone tunes - they are louder than the app speech and embarrassing when using away from home. Have an option to lower the milestone sounds and/or switch them off in away from home mode. Thanks!
"Duolingo is a good app to learn language, music and all. But the only problem with the app is the hearts, everytime you fail a lesson you have to either watch an ad or practice to earn heart which is pretty annoying. The number of heart should've been higher in my opinion. Good app tho"
it is amazing how much this App. has declined. sometimes even the translation option is not correct and consistently I have to go through a loop of trying to choose how I want to gain heart.I usually choose by practice but it comes Back to the beginning and asks me the same thing again. thank you
"I have really enjoyed learning languages with this app. Our whole family uses it. After this last update I cannot advance in lessons. It starts to load & then I get an error message ""An error occurred. Try again later"". This has been going on for days. It sounds like, from the reviews, a lot of us are having issues after the last update."
"Pretty good, thumbs up, silver star. I did learn a fair bit of Japanese here and learning the characters here is great. Dark mode. My settings doesn't have a dark/light mode to default to so anything will just default to light. Every time I switch the dark mode on it goes back to system default which for me, doesn't exist. So whenever I practice Japanese in the middle of the night I become blinded."
"The web version on PC is honestly better. Let's say you translate a sentence but got two or more words that are directly beside each other in the wrong positions, instead of just being able to drag them to their right positions, you have to remove all the words after the error and re insert them again as opposed to just DRAGGING the wrongly placed words to their right positions which is really convenient on my PC which I don't use as often. It would be really nice if this can be integrated üòá"
"I didn't finish an entire course yet, but i would imagine the app wont teach you very advanced stuff. Although i must say that ive learnt more french in 2 weeks with this, than from my school teachers in 2 years. It makes it easy to start learning a language, though if youre really serious about it you should seek more advanced courses/resources after a while. Some aspects of the ui are not very intuitive, for example i did not realize that gem counter also acts as the shop button."
"There are ads if ur not a premium and the constant race board is also really annoying because I'm just trying to learning sweadish in peace and at my own pace but with the leader board you feel rushed and like you have to constantly do lessons to keep up for getting demoted. But over all I really like duolingo, its helped so much."
"it's pretty amazing for learning the alphabet to your target language. If you're looking for an app to help you learn words, I think duolingo would work best if you're using other apps along with it and flash cards, etc. however I feel like the xp system needs improvement. duo encourages you to make language learning into a competitive game, but this doesn't work very well because it's a distraction from actually paying attention to what you're learning."
"This app has been wonderful. It has made it possible for me to start learning a language I would otherwise never have the chance to learn. My only complaint is that if I get stuck on a lesson and go through my hearts before I get all the way through it, my daily streak will reset even though I've been trying. It has a streak freeze for 2 days, but sometimes I get really stuck on one and it takes me longer to get through. It should count for my daily streak if I'm trying."
"Really doesn't teach you the fundamentals of a language or WHY certain things are the way they are, but it used to do that sometimes! That's my main issue with it! The app seems to keep getting more gameified and worse over time. If I'm learning a language, I need fundamentals before I can even attempt to learn conversation. Also, their use of AI is stupid and embarassing. Pay real translators."
"The stories will sometimes freeze at the end after pressing continue and does not complete the excercise. It doesnt matter if you write a response or not. I will normally start my day reviewing a story. When it doesn't complete, I will let it, run hoping it will finish and give me my points and my afternoon xp boost, but this doesnt always happen. Today I let it process 8 hrs."
"I've had Duolingo almost a year now. While it's very helpful to learn words and some grammar, nothing is explained as to WHY certain grammatical rules are the way they are. Having explanatory tips like that would be very helpful. A for the the match cards, they serve more to stress the user out because of such short timeframes. Instead of leaving an opportunity to properly match the words and put that to memory, users are forced to connect what can be seen as fast as possible."
"good app, would be great, but you need premium to utilize the even basic ""practice lesson courses."" the ones that explain grammar/sentence structure early on. It was a bit difficult due to only having half the information. also getting penalized for mistakes? if you don't get through your lessons in the 5 tries they allow, you don't get to learn. on one hand, it makes you really double down, on the other I'm limited on how much I can study in a givin day. otherwise, I do enjoy doulingo!"
"Not a bad app considering it's free (with limits unless subscribed). I already know some Korean but trying to get to a place where I can have a full on conversation. Only issues are, sometimes the voices that say the words to you are not pronounced clearly. So when you go to repeat it it fails sometimes. Not a big deal."
"Update: There is a critical bug in latest version. It must not be there,very trivial but somehow it is there. Issue 2: There are bugs in time limit check during timed streaks. It ends while about 20+ seconds remain, faced it multiple times. I can record it and provide. Which make me using the app or to subscribe. I am trying Japanese with this app. Some more improvements can be done, but given 4 stars due to good features and look of the application and content. Thanks"
"I would say this app is great at most things but going in brand new and just starting to learn a new language is difficult. It expects you to already know some of the language and mostly focuses on phrases and not the sounding of the words or any symbols in that language. In general, you need prior knowledge to even get far in this app and it doesn't help that you lose hearts if you get something wrong."
"Whoever the team behind this learning platform, you guys are amazing! At first, I had doubts that the learning method in this app will ever work. However, I was wrong! I started to see the change in less than 40 days! I am now able to read some basic french, I know a lot of words and grammars, I can write some basic French! Once I get a solid grip to French, I'll start moving to Italian or Spanish. Duolingo team, you guys are amazing, thank you for such a learning opportunity!"
"Consistently getting worse and worse over time. 1) Language courses are riddled with incorrect/incomplete or non-sensical translations. 2) No real people are monitoring feedback for the courses. 3) Because of 2) there are no way to express feedback for 1). 4) Artificial delays and unskippable animations are added to waste more of your time on the app. 5) Helpful social features are consistently getting removed to make your experience worse, instead added useless features like avatar constructor."
"Duolingo is generally a great, fun way to learn. However, I had a maddening experience. I was unable to complete a level because the acceptable answer continued to change, as a scene was enacted where a person was asking for more coffee. The question asked where this person was. Bar, restaurant, and cafeteria were each answers at different times. I burned several hearts and gems to complete, yet if I did not guess the correct answer at that given time (with no context), I was wrong. Unacceptable"
"I already use some Spanish on a daily basis. This app rated my knowledge and has started me at an appropriate level. I'm disappointed in the mistakes some of the exercises contain that have caused me to fail two different questions/exercises. They were a problem in the app vocabulary that offer incorrect choices. Overall It's easy to use, and I like the variety of games to give me skills in the critical areas of comprehension."
"Overall, I thoroughly enjoy using Duolingo to learn except one thing. As a Free User, I do not like when I ""Earn a Free Super Duo"" I don't like the interphase. If I had the ability to turn it off completely. I like the practices for Accuracy Repetition and Speed. If Y'all's could pop a Switch in the Profile options (or summut) I would most certainly rate your Lovely application *****. Sincerely. Ryan McKeag."
"I've been using it for years and I've loved it. But some of the new features on here have started to bother me. I dislike how lessons are being taught now, and it has become repetitive and tiresome. I know I am able to skip to the next unit if I've learned enough, but I dislike the feeling of not fully finishing it all. Also I dislike the new avatar profiles, I wish they were optional! I miss my old profile picture with my dog, I didn't think I would be stuck using the avatars..."
"this is actually a really great app! my only problem is the animations. they seem too sensitive. if i leave the app running in the background for too long, all animations and special fx stop working. then i have to go to settings and clear my data, which is an annoying process (i usually have to reset my settings). so, duolingo, can you please fix this problem? it would be greatly appreciated."
"Duolingo,doulingo the app you always listen about on the internet we'll I thought let's try it, ü§î its an amazing app it's like a game but what do you need more to make a better language learning app. amazing characters they have it making a language look easy they have it and much much more it'd an amazing app to download and it's really fun üòÑüòÅüòÅ"
"Super great! I was enrolled in a Chinese dual emersion a few years back, and I got Duolingo to help stay on top of it when I moved. It worked wonders, but I was a little disappointed that it didn't teach me how to write new characters. I know that lost languages you learn are not character based, but it would be a nice feature I hope to see in the future. ---UPDATE--- They added the ability to draw Chinese Hanzi! This is a feature that makes studying well worth it."
"Just a suggestion, why don't you add audio on the English words??? its ok, but I'm just saying this could really improve Duolingo for me and I bet for many others too... If this is done I would be really thankful... Otherwise, this is a really awesome app, and I really love the progress I have been able to make on this app. Another thing is that it has the really nice friends and thing where you can friend and follow people, there are also leagues and leaderboards that I love."
"I've been using it for 8 days. I'm loving it so far. Update; 195 days in, lots of bugs suddenly appearing. Errors rarely fixed, have to see them over and over again through the lessons. Progress is very, very slow. Introduce new ideas, words etc without explanation. Have to guess and hope your understanding of it is correct."
"It's great! You get to learn a language. I'm learning Japanese üç°. They celebrate your progress. and others can too! They put it in the feed. there's a leaderboard so you can rank up! There's tips in the feed every few days. There's cool fun things they do in it as well. Or XP ramp - ups sometimes. You can get a streak, I'm around the 60 streak. I recommend this game üòÅüéØ"
"It's good if you want to learn some words but it's not very useful if you want to learn grammar and stuff. Of course it can't make you fluent. Also in some languages it goes really fast and you can't catch up with it or the progress is very slow (but this is not much of a problem, you memorize it better). But if your goal is it learn some phrases so you can communicate in another country or you just want to have some fun learning, Duolingo is one of the best apps for this."
"I enjoy doing Duolingo it's just that it doesn't give me animations. also with my friend they actually have an avatar instead of just having a profile picture. When they open their settings to change what they want, back to the animations the only animation that works is why I get the double XP bottle. Also I can't follow people on Duolingo and some achievements that other people for some reason I don't earn the achievement or they don't give me the achievement, it's very annoying."
"Great learning app. covers all modalities of learning and repeats to learn where needed to check understood. its actually made fun too , like a game ... considering languages were never my stong point naturally, I'm doing well and really enjoying all, the speaking, listening and written, it even provides motivational incentives to keep up consistent daily learning and with realistic targets... so it must be a pretty exceptional app if I can do it ;-)... enjoy! x"
"it is a great tool to learn sentence structure so you van get into basic conversation. I don't think fluency should be a goal if you're using duolingo alone. it's very fun and easy, I have noticed a drop in sentence quality after the AI overhaul"
"I have been using Duolingo for a while now. It has been a nice experience so far with occasional hiccups. Good job! Inclusive conversation could be extended to include other groups of people with mental and physical conditions, minority culture/traditions like Pacific Islanders, etc. there are many features that can be added on top of same gender relationships, which is the one and only inclusive feature in Duolingo."
"the streak, leaderboards, powerups add to the gamified feel, and i really like that. it keeps you hooked. i dont really have a problem with the ads, cuz at the end of the day, they gotta earn money. But it feels like their pushing their 'super' subscription too much. Legendary levels, which is essentially free xp, is only available to super users. You have to spend atrocious amounts of gems to get it, and the chests only give you little. 5 hearts aint enough, cuz were *learning* a language!"
"The app needs more work for Scottish. The more you learn the new words, the less you hear the new words. There are several words that won't give an audio, so it makes it hard to pronounce the word when you're reading it. Also, if you click on the Scottish word for fill in the blank, the newer words won't sound out, but the old words from earlier in the app when you started will. Please fix this issue. This language doesn't need to be lost."
"Easy to use. It has a rewards system to make it ""fun"" to learn. However, that reward system mostly rewards speed. This is fine to quickly recognise a spoken language but leaves little to no room for beginners to practise speaking the words and pronouncing them correctly. So if you power through and select answers quickly, you will be rewarded but taking the time to practice speaking words and sentences aloud will cost you rewards. Why would you rush whilst learning a new language?"
"It's great for learning languages but there are tons of bugs that need to get fixed. But The developments won't fix them, in fact they won't look at our rating even though they say leave us a feedback. sometimes the audio won't load or glitches, it also won't load some levels and you'll get stuck and can't learn anything anymore, the free 2 weeks ""Super"" does not work for me and sometimes when you run out of time in the Rapid Review it won't load and you'll lose 100 gems. I lost 300 gems."
It is a good except when you get to higher levels it is super fussy about writing and spelling. If the goal is to improve your pronunciation and comprehension it is pretty useless. I honestly don't care about having competent spelling in German. I need to up my verbal game and this isn't helpful.
"It's a fun way of learning and I really like it, but the only thing that absolutely ticks me off is the people who use Super. It gives an unfair advantage to others and while I keep having to be in the champion things with a BUNCH of people who use it, it just feels absolutely unfair. I think that it would be more fair if we were all in different leagues, people who use Super can go against people who use Super and people who use regular Duolingo can go against people who use the regular version"
"it's a great app many positives but sometimes certain things aren't explained throughly after some practices, I feel it can be a bit fast with learning new words and not repetitive enough with them. I lost a 59 day streak because I got a bit overwhelmed not being able to keep up with new words. Other than that, it's a fun app. They have fun friendly competitions and little fun rewards, and you can meet people."
"It's ok for learning a language, but that's about it. There's nothing outside of the little game it has, and that can be easily optimized to become a glorified match three. The puzzles just aren't engaging or complicated enough to truly force you to learn, and some of the mechanics actively dissuade progression. It's good for daily reminders, but only works as a supplement to more intense classes."
"Honestly, I am not very good at learning languages. So when I looked at this app I was pleasantly surprised. The bright and cheerful way to learn languages appeals to me, and games and stories feels very natural. My only complaint would be the app has ads frequently, (using the duolingo site bypassed them) & the loss of hearts when you get something wrong. I want to learn so I opted for super Duolingo subscription. No longer waiting for refill."
"I am a a bilingual person. I wanted to practice Spanish and thought this app would be perfect. It's not. The app doesn't account for the grammar half the time. It weirdly switches back and forth between grammatically correct translation to a direct translation. It's weird. It'll say ""los pans"" to ""bread."" It's PLURAL in Spanish, and I reporting it doesn't so anything. I regret spending money on it. I wouldn't recommend this app."
"I loved this app. After a few weeks using this for the first time. I'm a new beginner. I noticed that some bugs that need to be fix. The app glitched frequently, for a example, question said ""the girl"" it supposed to answer question and type in ""la Nina"" but I couldn't type it. It give me an errors message. I've reported these glitches. And... There are no grammar tips for helps. Very frustrating. It makes me to unsubscribe duolingo plus edition because of some bugs and glitch. This app is trash"
"I don't like the random words they throw in for you to repeat the correct option without saying what on earth it is . definitely not enough time to go over past learning .it seems v rushed to me . some basic months of the year ,numbers ,days of the week colours etc would be useful. yes I get the sentences right but it's kinda obvious if your English is good.but I don't really know it"
"I want to give Duolingo a better review. I really do! It eases you into topics well and the repetition based learning is legitimately useful. But the Android app is so full of bugs that it's really frustrating. Sometimes the app will claim that you've won an XP boost for finishing a module only for it to never appear, other times your daily score just won't update or will just revert to what it was last time you opened the app. The list goes on. Good for teaching, but frustrating app."
"This app seems pretty great at first, but then you figure out that it's mostly just made to make money. The learning is good, but as it gets harder, it makes you feel way more demotivated to actually learn the language. The ads are 99% of the time for Super duolingo, and in the ad, they say they get rid of the ads, so they are literally just getting rid of the ad for no ads. I think you're just better off learning a language from someone in person who actually speaks the language."
Makes it fun to learn. I feel that the heart system hurts the experience. There are ads for non subscribers and then the subscription allows to remove ads and also unlimited hearts. But with ads people who are not paid users should still not have the heart system to allow truly free learning as well. There's still the option to buy gems for all users as an income revenue for Duolingo.
"this is the third time I've picked it up and definitely the time I've been most consistent. I think deleting other attention grabbing apps helped, but engaging with the whole app too is useful, playing the challenges, utilising the earl bird/night owl double XP loop. A suggestion to add to the app would be a verb challenge game in the practice section, where it just gives you variations of all learned verbs, they work, you sleep etc."
"fun characters make it easier to learn - and much more enjoyable! streaks make you want to come back and learn, along with leader boards. I don't have super, but you only get a short add after you complete a lesson, so not as bad you might think. also you only get 5 hearts (so five mistakes) and if you use them up, either you must refill with gems (earned by completing challenges) or wait a few hours before they refill on their own all in all, it's a great - and fun - way to learn!"
"It forces you to use the app daily and try to rank first in every league. its frustrating when I barely have any time, especially playing other games that gets put first by duo. its good motivation but i widh this was just a choice to compete with other people. i would just want to learn the language. either way, it doesn't know much about how to actually speak it. only the textbook versions."
"The best, I love it. Easy, fun, and interesting I can take different courses at the same time. It is easy You can learn the target language so fast. Just, I don't know why his face is still upset, even though I have gone throw my lessons. Even more than the plan. Suggest you to try it."
"This is a good app, been using it for over a year. The format and usability are excellent. The introduction of new vocabulary is too slow, about 6 new words a unit, each unit has about 30, 5-8 minute lessons. I do a couple a day, a unit takes me a couple of weeks. 6 words in 2 weeks is not nearly enough, becomes very repetitive. I use DuoCards to learn new words."
"This App no longer works on my phone. I uses my phone data but it doesn't work, all it keeps showing was you are offline. The funny thing is, it's the only app having this experience. Even when I updated the app it doesn't work unless you're connected to a wifi. So I need help so as to continue my learning."
"I think that Duolingo is a great app to learn a language. I think the thing that bugs me is that there isn't enough incentive to put a lot of effort into tournaments as a non-Super user. Yes, you receive more gems, but you rarely get free Super days. Also, they put you up against Super users. Yes, Super users paid for advantages, but having to compete against them is unfair and not reflective of the effort of the learner at all! It would be better if the tournaments were categorized."
"(Edit) I figured out the speaking exercise problems. also, It will not let me use the widgets? I'm using a miui android, so that may have something to do with it. I would press the ""Try Now!"" button, but it wouldn't do anything. I would press on my home screen, but Duolingo wasn't an option for the widgets I can add. plus, it says I unlocked a widget and I thought that might be why it doesn't let me! But no, it won't work still. Please help! üåü üá™üá∏ü¶âüü¢üó∫Ô∏è"
"The app used to be great, but I've noticed a decline in sentence quality in several languages since the update. The app crashes frequently, often when I'm mid lesson. It's also not uncommon for me to do one of the practices to earn hearts or watch a video to gain a heart, and then end up getting nothing."
"It's fine, but it doesn't teach grammar properly. Neither does it accept many other options if you translate a sentence. Like, I've lived in Germany for my whole life so I obviously know german grammar. And I sometimes ""learn"" German/English to earn Xp, but it doesn't accept every sentence in german (even though it's completely correct and you can 100% say it that way too). It's really annoying, cause when you learn a language with many different grammar stuff, you should have more options."
"I wish I had more hearts, rarely any ads though there are some. IDK what type of conversation Duolingo thinks people are having but a can successfully say ""car is a spoon"" in French. I downloaded Duo because I'm in a French class and it does help to just review some words. I like that you can review lessons, having a streak is a goal and something that I personally look forward to. I do recommend this app!"
"I enjoy using Duolingo on a daily basis as it is easily accessible and easy to get started. I am learning Norwegian in about 15 - 30 minutes a day. There is repetition of words and phrases in various ways so that I am able to eventually remember more and more vocabulary and sentence sentence structure rules in a natural way. There are ways to include competition with yourself and also with Duolingo ""friends"" to encourage one to continue practicing which leads to improvement. I like how easy is"
"Loved Duolingo....at first....but there's no way to retake each level (only a REVIEW option) so realised that as I would progress further with no way to redo a lesson, I found the first unit really hard towards end, only option I found is to remove the language and start completely over. Was willing to pay for the superduolingo up to that point ‚òπÔ∏è"
"I miss the older version. I understand incentivising for a paid version but it prioritises competition over learning. Anyone learning a language understands there are areas where we struggle. The best thing is to practise multiple times until we feel more comfortable. This option is mostly gone in the updated free version. Practising completed sections costs gems. Also, the league system pushes people to do more new lessons instead of reinforcing what's been learnt. Much less is retained now."
App is great for staying consistent with language learning. I just wanna say that they added a new feature recently where you can refill your xp boost for 100 gems. Neat. But I wish there was a confirmation before purchasing. I was almost done my lessons for the moment but I accidentally hit the purchase button while rushing through lessons. A waste of 100 hard earned gems that could've been easily prevented
"It is a great way to start learning a language. The gamification and streak count keep you motivated. But you can get a perfect score without actually learning the vocabulary, especially in later lessons. The platform could benefit from flashcards and passive listening practices where you don't have to be looking at the phone."
"Taking the Hindi course, answers are often incorrect and the app punishes you by preventing you from continuing lessons after you make mistakes. The course is also way too short: after two sections and barely a couple months, the app runs out of new material to teach, after hardly having even taught the basics, and just resorts to asking you the same questions over and over again. Really disappointing and pretty useless."
"Update: 2 months, still not earning points for completing lessons. The latest update has made the app even glitchier than before. I haven't earned points/gems for completed lessons since the update (aside from when watching ads or opening treasure chests). Aside from the hopefully temporary glitch, I love this app. Updated about a week later: I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, still not getting points/gems for completing lessons."
"Duolingo is a great app in learning different languages, and it forces you to consistently learn it everyday or you lose all your achievements on the app. The one thing I find in this app that needs improvement is that, they should allow people to interact through ""voice note"" so that we can be better when interacting with people in another language. Duolingo is great in individual writing skills, and individual speaking skills but interacting speaking skills needs to be improved."
"Duolingo is an excellent app to start learning a new language. The only thing I would say needs improvement would be, more work. I mean to say, give more options to learn. when doing my lessons, I rarely have to write and mostly selecting what I heard, while this helps me learn, it helps alot, I wish you could do other things, possibly more ""hands on"". Like make me create a sentence or a story. I'm not very far in my learning experience here, only two weeks in, so maybe I'm speaking too soon."
"Only good for the most popular languages. I'm trying to learn Greek and there is no grammar whatsoever. I tried Spanish for comparison, where you get to view grammatical rules and explanations. Not so for Greek, or Dutch, and it's very difficult to learn a language by just guessing grammatical concepts from example sentences."
"Definitely makes learning a language fun (and addicting). Not having a subscription is tolerable, if you're patient with yourself. I wouldn't rely on this entirely for seriously learning a language, because it doesn't cover grammar very thoroughly. Although I understand the necessity of learning a language ""as you go,"" focused grammar study is important. Duolingo would help students more if a quick grammar rule was taught each time a new grammar concept was introduced. This need not be dry!"
"Duolingo is an amazing app in its own type. It's really enjoyable when you learn new languages that much easy. Actually, everything is fine, but the only thing that is annoying a little bit is the lack of some perfect and classical languages like Persian. You can learn fictional language on duolingo, but there is no possibility of learning a REAL and nice language like Persian."
"This is a fun game to play! It is well designed to keep you invested. Sadly there is no way to personalize it so our trip has come and gone before we were taught how to speak as a tourist. I am so done with talking about pens and school. Duo, please find a way to personalize the learning. I have no reason to EVER use the work, school or university information that is on my path before I can say turn left or turn right. I have come so close to deleting the app never to return but we keep trying!!"
Great for learning a little bit of a language (no fluency but for sure some basic knowledge). My only two issues are that it is hard to know when plural you and when singular you is used without getting a hint. It'd be nice if that could be clarified somehow. The other is that there is no section for grammar whatsoever which makes it incredibly hard to learn specifically verbs and their conjugations. Instead you learn every verb-form as its own word. It doesn't give any rules what to do.
"Generally amazing language learning app but the AI-based(?) course improvement feature is impacting my experience badly. Please add an option to opt out/reverse the automatic course adjustments or improve it as it ruined/stalled my progress for quite some time. All completed units now contain several new words, sometimes 50%+ of the content is new, including grammar. Old vocab & grammar I already learned will be repeated in upcoming units. The topical progression also became less logical."
"really enjoy it so far! can't think of any improvements it may need. Edit: Aggressive ads to make me buy the premium version? I've bought it, and I will again in just can't afford it right now. So just because of that unethical business tactic I'm giving it two stars. You should rely on the quality of your app, not overly numerous ads to profit. I understand the need for ads of we're not paying for the premium. But at this point with all companies it's a war for attention and it's unethical."
"Initially, I gave the app 5 starts, but I reduced it to 2 stars because, for some reason, even when I am clearly online and connected to the internet, the app keeps saying I'm offline. I lose opportunities to take my lessons and enjoy the double XP bonus time."
"I started using Duolingo in 2016 and due to some recent update it completely deleted my account and I wrote to customer service who never responded. Nevertheless I started a new account, but now I'm traveling and want to practice in the country I'm in, but it won't let me log in unless I have a local number from the country I'm traveling in... literally learning a language to travel, but can't practice while I'm traveling. Terrible experience. Would not recommend for people who plan to travel."
Excellent app with a wide variety of languages and especially good for beginning to learn those with scripts different from Latin. Even the free version is sufficient. It's a versatile tool that's as good as your ability to use it. It's so good that's it's even a favourite among those who like to bash other apps and platforms inorder to promote their own.
"They restructured the Japanese language course and threw me into a whole new Section that assumes I know a lot of words that I haven't learned yet. I can barely progress following the new lesson structure and I don't even know which lessons I should go back to. An option to revert back to the older structure, at least until I finish the section I was originally on would be nice."
"Exceptional to use for beginners but here's an option. When you are learning the language of your choice you compete with other users that are learning a different language. I would suggest to separate those learning Gaelic into a Gaelic league & those into other separate leagues as per their own language. This way we would be able to compete with someone with the same challenges. The loophole as it is that I can use the English as a ""cheat"" tactic since I already speak English. Just sayin"
"It has been revised. It's more gamified and is more fun, but I think I'm missing the writing parts. Maybe they're coming up as I advance. I think this is a fun way to learn basic vocab and grammar. Of course, as with everything, you get more out of it if you put more time in. Fun, not magic! NB: Impossible to find pricing for premium plan. This info should be very easy to find. One star off."
This app is great 130 days in. Only real problem is that I get warnings in the middle of the night telling me I'm going to lose my streak and use a streak freeze regardless of whether I have done a lesson that day or not. I really wish they would fix this glitch. Also when I get an answer wrong the correction often covers up my answer so I can't check it to see what I did wrong. Then it kicks you out if you get too many wrong instead of just making you a watch an ad or something.
"I would've happily given Duolingo 5 stars as I really enjoy it had they not completely ripped me off. they advertise the 2 week trial of Superduolingo by saying that they will alert you 2 days prior to the trial ending so you can decide if you want to keep it or not before you are charged. well they never sent me any notices. not in the app, not in my email, nada. so I didn't realize until a few days later that it was past the trial date & by then I was charged $85. don't do the ""free trial""!!!"
"Really grateful for Zulu, so thank you! But I often practice after midnight yet that wastes a streak freeze? Also, stop the clock when we are PROVIDING YOU with valuable feedback on an error where an answer should have been accepted.. Also, accepted minor errors (without penalty) should include a misplaced letter, i.e. ""bhuti"" vs ""buthi"", not just vowel swaps, etc. Lastly, double XP for 15 minutes isn't much of a motivation, in my humble opinion."
"I loved this app and I still use it regularly. However, it's very frustrating when they restructure the lessons every few months and suddenly it tries to teach me something I already know, but then wants to test me on something it never taught me in the first place."
"duolingo is a great idea, more knowledge and a good way to pass the time. It is also good if you are travelling and want to earn some words in that language. But if you are hoping to learn a language fluently or even close to fluent, duolingo is not for you, I speak with experience."
"Fun video game, terrible way to learn a language. I'm over 400 days into an unbroken streak and consistently place in the leaderboards. Yet, I can't speak the language at all and can barely read signs when I visit. It offers no foundation into the grammar and rules of the language, offers little to no repetition or vocabulary building, not even flashcards. It's a fun video game but useless as a learning tool. I'd recommend try ANYTHING else."
"The comments section had very useful tips on the language I was learning, and I browsed it often. It's been removed for whatever reason, and i think it should be re-added. Profile pictures have also been removed and replaced with avatars that are devoid of life. At least with uploaded photos, it felt somewhat like a person was on the other end of that username. The app is still fun, but updates have definitely made it worse."
"Loving every course I've started and I'm confident if I actually stick with it I'll be multilingual in no time! I have two different accounts on the same family plan between my old apple device and this android. Around seven courses each, going back and forth between devices makes the number of courses I've taken on seem more manageable. BTW, the new music theory course is FANTASTIC and the new math course is perfect for young kids and adults who want to regain lost skills and/or brain train."
"This language learning app is amazing! I love how I can choose between using a plan or not, I can learn at my own pace, and they always motivate me to learn every day and keep my streak growing. Learning spanish in school was a struggle, but now I can enjoy it and correct my mistakes. And the adds I feel are very minimal, so I only focus on my quick but rewarding lessons."
"I really wish I could give this app more stars. I like the lessons and how interactive and applicable they are, but the app frequently doesn't register when I've completed a lesson at all, even if I close the app or sign out, which makes it impossible to progress. It's very frustrating, especially when it happens on a Legendary level."
"A helpful language-learning tool, but in need of improvements. Search capability would be helpful to review specific categories, rather than following a specific path. They also purposely place buttons to use gems (buy & use timer boost packs, increase 2X periods) in ways that you are very likely to hit accidentally (e.g., timed tasks), which is very frustrating when this is not your intent -- they insert screens everywhere else except when they're trying to take your gems. Unsure if I'll renew."
"I can't get enough of Duolingo! This app has revolutionized the way I learn languages. The interactive lessons, engaging exercises, and friendly interface make learning a new language a breeze. Whether it's brushing up on basics or diving into more advanced topics, Duolingo has it all. The gamified approach keeps me motivated, and the bite sized lessons fit perfectly into my daily routine. Plus, the variety of languages available ensures there's always something new to explore."
"I love duolingo! It covers a variety of scenarios and a variety of teaching methods (listening practice, writing, and speaking). And it has several incentives to keep learning, such as league rankings, earning points you can use, and the ability to build a streak if you practice religiously. You can follow your friends and have the ability to congratulate or nudge someone along to encourage their progress, and even participate in friends ""quests"" to earn badges etc. Its üëç"
"I had downloaded this app after my mock results at school where i was failing french and have already made significant improvements in a month and am now passing french by just using this app alone. This app is perfect to learn from as long you keep with your ""streaks"" for 2-5 minutes per day and the game style is also engaging. Its in depth, offers tips and is enjoyable. I dont have duolingo ""super learner"" but it is not necessary to use app at all."
I appreciate the app. It's helpful to brush up on french but I hate the freeze streak intensity. I wish I could turn freeze streaks off. I get on when I gave time I don't need to be inundated with freeze streak reminders and goals. Im sure some ppls learning styles may like that but I find it cumbersome. Please make a way to turn freeze streaks off for ppl who don't need that incentive. For ppl who do like it they can keep it on.
"A great deal of fun learning a new language : √à molto divertente imparare una nuova lingua. Keep in mind, concentrate only on your individual progress and learning. There are a bunch of people who either already know the language or use duolingo as though it is a game to score points and defeat everyone else involved, making it difficult to advance levels. Apparently, these folks have hours to score thousands, ensuring they advance but average learners don't. Its still enjoyable."
"I totally love the app and the way you can learn a language! (Ok, maybe you could learn some basics earlier in the course) But overall I love it. Only 2 things I really hate are: the ""I can't listen now"" is on the wrong place, or you should confirm it. You tap it to easily when you go to the next question. And the 2nd thing...I personally hate the super duo Lingo. Once in a time I get a couple of days free....BUT I DON'T WANT IT, I HATE IT!!!! So please let us choose if you want it!"
"I've definitely learned a lot from Duo, but I don't like the heart system very much (there are ways to get around paying for hearts, but it's a little annoying). The ranking system is a little weird as well. Additionally, some translations don't fit quite right, and it doesn't explain grammatical stuff very well, but overall, you can learn quite a bit as long as you get in the habit of doing a few lessons everyday"
"Good for adding vocabulary, although sometimes not as relevant as one might like. For example, after level one I can say 'My neighbour is timid', which could come later in the course with some more frequently used vocabulary learned earlier on. I feel this would give me more of a sense that I am actually achieving something."
"As someone who used it as a way to stop playing completely mindless phone games on my phone, I think it works pretty well, with the heart system stopping me from going too long. When compared to other mobile games it holds up pretty well, the ads aren't too invasive but they push the membership a lot. Main issues are that leaderboard and match madness are pay to win. Plus, it doesn't teach much, the sentences sound fake, and the placement tests are broken. It's annoying at times but pretty good"
"im learning Japanese using Chinese, but the Chinese is terrible. my answers are often considered wrong just because they're different from the expected answers. obviously there are different ways of saying, the alternatives are even listed when i tap on the word! it's ridiculous that i ""failed"" not at my target language, but my native language..."
"I love Duolingo. The app has taught me a lot of vocabulary and useful phrases, which is what I expected, but using it often (a few times a day) has given me confidence to speak Spanish to native speakers in both my work and personal life. The ads are annoying, but you can upgrade to Super Duolingo and blah blah blah. Despite the ads and my frugal app spending, Duolingo is great."
"It has alot of problems for japanese, but as a beginner it's way better than nothing. As of writing; there is an annoying bug with pronunciation above characters being in the wrong language (I just want to read it in hiragana). It's like the app doesn't remember the setting uppon opening a new session."
"Thank you for making me competitive and utilizing my love for games in the most productive way. The app is perfect for learning any popular language in the most simplified and fun manner. Just one problem, the app shows ""You're offline"" sometimes and spontaneously even when my mobile data is working perfectly on other apps like Google. Kindly fix this, thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Duolingo French is a wonderful app that makes fun and easy learning. However my greatest challenge is the speaking part. I often use the recorder to record my voice but it keeps telling me that my response isn't correct and for that reason I can't move over to the next page. I have been in stage 2 for over 3 days now and can't advance until I answer correctly the speaking part. I don't know if the recorder isn't recording my voice or the audio isn't recognizing my answers as a native. Pls help!
It's alright. It is definitely not perfect. I find it is helping me a bit but I don't find it will fully help me learn French. The learning progress is not very decent at times. Some lessons are extremely easy and others are extremely difficult. I find the progression is not very decent. This is a programming issue. The sounds effects of mistakes do not help too in my opinion. After awhile this makes you feel like a failure and it becomes negative which makes you want to stop.
"they fired almost everyone who worked for them and replaced them with AI. They lock the best features for education behind a paywall. Duolingo is fun, but you'd need to get a premium account and devote at least 30 minutes a day to actually learn a language with it in a reasonable time frame. It's Stories are probably the best feature they had, and now it's premium only."
"Amazing app. 100,000% recommended. It really helps you work on what you need, and even if you don't have Super Duolingo, it still helps because it helps you practice more to get more hearts. I do really recommend the Super Duolingo, as it is amazingly easy to use and it's helpful for learning."
"Latest update is even worse. The current structure does not work well and makes lessons particularly confusing and removes revision options. Update: new structure is still terrible and learning progress is halted tremendously. Please also stop automatically skipping ahead in lessons. It forces new lessons without having the chance to practice current ones. And stop forcing super duolingo on me! I do not want it, and will not buy it. Forcing me to use it makes me not want to use this app."
"I really like this app as it has improved my other language skills SO much! But I wish I could turn off the weekly leaderboard thingy, because my life is pretty hard and busy these days (I still wanna keep my streak) and I dont have the time to get that much ""XP"", and its really stressing that im always just falling off to the previous league. Moral of the story: Can you please add an option to turn off weekly leaderboards? üíö"
"Dropping all the way to 1 star. I pay for the premium service, and as of today (3/18/24), I haven't been credited ANY XP since this morning. I am vigilant about playing 2-3 times daily. Suddenly, I am not getting XP, nor am I credited for completing daily tasks. They made it a competition and then took my legs from under me by cheating me. I'm sick of emailing them EVERY DAY about one problem or the other. FIX IT DEVS!!! I pay to play, not to be distressed daily. I wish 0 üåü was possible."
"The progression is very good. I like how we learn by using and reusing the same words and sentences. Learning grammar and rules is ok, but practice makes perfect right? Duo builds your reflexes so you know how to say something without having to first think about the rules. And it feels a bit like a game, so you want to do 'just one more'... :) Great app."
"So far so good, the learning is step by step so far it's constant and not also. You would learn bits and pieces of the letters and characters for the language your learning and them go over the words/ phases that googs alone with them then you move on. If you feel like you need to move on ahead or go over the words/ phases, you can go at your own pace or go day by day and compete with others across the world. rating 4 stars because nothing is perfect and always need improvement."
"Its good, everything is good, great if you buy the paid version, but you could do it for free, you do like a story mode and you do it lesson by lesson. but one of the questions on a lesson is to type some words and sometimes, I don't know how to spell the words, but I still know them, so that's why it's 4 stars, if there is no more typing, then it'll be 5 stars"
"Pros: Enjoyable interface. Great materials & variety of aspects. Formatted for efficient & coherent learning. The difficulty level good for progressing, unlike other apps from random levels. Progression path clear. Cons: AmEnglish. Subscribers still are asked to pay for extras. Unnatural word order translations (Italian>English). Match Madness words appear severely delayed to lose & buy boost. Ramp-up boost always deducts gems but not always acknowledges the 80xp was successful & asks to repeat."
"Overall an ok app for very beginners...the app has a glitch in listening despite correct pronunciation (only for '50 euros' and '10 euros' in Italian-my pronunciation is perfect as I speak Spanish, but it won't accept it no matter how many times I repeat it! ) No opportunity for continuous dialogue. I think this is the biggest downfall. No opportunity to print lessons. I've tried contacting support but no response."
"Not particularly logical, new concepts introduced at random. Very childish in places and not helpful with learning grammar. I still don't understand the rewards system. Irritatingly frequent reminders to practice. If I was starting a language from scratch, I think I'd find it difficult with this app, and I wouldn't pay to use it."
Really helpful for language learning and good for encouraging daily learning. Slightly centred on the Americas as I learned Portuguese only to realise that some words were different as Duolingo had focused on Brazilian Portuguese rather than European Portuguese. Also the English translations are in American English so are slightly different. It generally is very helpful though and a fun way of learning.
"After four years, the lessons are too hard. I'm going back and starting over. There's so much I don't understand. The app only let me go back to the beginning of Unit 40, but I need to relearn some things way before that. The changes that were made a year or so ago that were supposed to make the app more personalized are not personal. The things I need help with are never retaught. The old app before the updates had conversations that were very helpful to me. It also let me go back to relearn."
"I have a 279 day streak (super dualingo) in learning Japanese and I don't know if this is an app for learning languages or a generic mobile game that happens to be about languages. Grammar points are not explained at all, the sentences sound unnatural because they are apparently not generates and spoken by humans. Often times the wrong furigana are used. The notifications are broken, I often get some even if I have already seen them. The app often fails to start (not only on my phone)."
"I'm only going to give it 4 stars after 5 because of the speaking test that isn't working either in the free version or the super version every time I hit (Tap to speak) it refuses immediately and tells me that something is not right please try again and every time I try again it keeps give me the same response until it tells me failed and let me lose hearts for nothing. So, PLEASE FIX IT."
This is so much more fun and interactive than previous language apps i have used. And im actually learning and sticking to it! 5 stars! 15/3/24 FEEDBACK EDIT: Lately the app has been resetting my progress every time i log in and I have to keep repeating lessons. Please fix this glitch as I am becoming quite frustrated at never moving forward.
"this is an amazing app, gamification, motivation, good content. But I'm giving this a 2 start instead of 5 because of one single issue that totally breaks the system: You get double XP for a review (with always the same questions) vs normal courses that take double the time and only give half the XP, resulting in you only doing reviews if you quickly want to be on top of leaderboard. it should be the opposite or at least the same XP, or even better, time based XP!"
"Duolingo was fun at first but when I tried creating a profile, it kept saying that I didn't create one. I kept on creating a new one, but it did not help. Duolingo NEEDS to fix this. As well as that, I believe the heart system is outrageous. It is basically saying you are not allowed to make mistakes and you get punished for it. This is extremely frustrating because learning a new language is not easy. Also, most of the things that SHOULD be already provided needs to bought with a subscription."
"Since current month updates (Apr 2024) it becomes very annoying and expensive app to support. It plays ads after every lesson you do and became expensive to do special events, like Match Madness or Ramp Up challenges, jumping from 20 gems to 100 gems each try. It's absolutely ridiculous since a chest on unit course offer just 5 or 10 gems each. It looks like it will get worse, boring and not affordable, instead of getting better, cheap and playful."
"Edit: the path update is terrible, the app is no longer worth using. Really great for learning a new language. However - Poor updates add too many prompts and animations. Chinese language course needs updating and some translation errors have been reported for a long time without fixing."
there used to be a vocabulary of the words you've learned. It was very useful. It's sadly gone. The app could also do better when providing theory for the unit. Like what forms the words might have. Now you just kind of try to pick up while doing lessons instead of having a definition somewhere you can come back to.
"This app is AMAZING! I love how short each level is. Learn as much as you what, when you want, and how you want. I also like how when you start a language course you take a ""placement quiz."" That way if you have some prior knowledge of a language it can place you accordingly. Also the achievements and badges you can earn are motivating. :) Fantastic work, Duolingo!"
"This app was excellent up until the recent ""path"" update. In their attempts to gamify the app, it's become slow and tedious taking an incredibly long time to learn any new words at all. No longer really that useful for learning a language compared with the old configuration. I suppose they did this to push people into using the paid version, but the new update is so hopeless I have less interest than ever."
"I have used it for Italian and, currently, French over the years to get some basic language skills for holidays. It's better than just a phrase book but the frequent push to upgrade to the paid version is intrusive. I understand they need to make money but I find only having so many 'lives' makes it more challenging."
"When English is the native language used by the learner, the exercises are fairly good and very imaginative at times, but if I do the same course using Spanish as the native language, often times the translations provided are irrational and grammatically incorrect. Also feedback is often not working for such examples hence I'm leaving my feedback here."
The app still keeps bombarding me with the Super Duolingo plan literally after every lesson I do and I'm still NOT INTERESTED IN SUPER DUOLINGO!!! My 1 star rating will stay here until this changes which is a shame because otherwise I really like the app and it moves my language learning progress forward. It is just disgusting practice...
"Maybe I could go with 5 Stars but I'm giving 2 starts because I don't know what's wrong with this app. When I downloaded it for the first time, i used to spend so much time learning my favourite language but after sometime the audio stopped working so I uninstalled it. And after whole 1 year (lol) yesterday night I installed it, it worked finely but from today morning i go online but it shows you're offline. And it's irritating,So please do something about it."
"I love using this app to learn Spanish but I feel like it rarely actually teaches me and relies solely on repetition. Which is fine, I just wish it taught me based on common mistakes. Also, I just completed 5 levels during a double XP time and it didn't count any of my points on the leaderboard??? Can this get fixed??"
The learning experience is quite lacking in options. You are forced down a gamified path that is completely arbitrary and doesn't summarize at any point where you are on your learning journey. This is more of a 'do your dailies' type of game more than a learning tool. Hopefully something might stick. 2/5
"My original review was a joke. Just like the heart system. ""It's about progress not perfection"", then remove hearts. If I had a penny for every time I was on one heart and couldn't make mistakes, Rich. Also they wait to teach you important grammar stuff that would be useful long ago. Like in Spanish they wait for the lesson about when to use bebo and when to use bebes, a system that also applies to most words. Although I was learning Japanese, I moved to Spanish cause I could use it. I have more"
good app to learn basic Spanish but impossible to progress once you get to a higher level without super duolingo. cannot learn from mistakes as you have to continously quit the lesson. should make it a better learning experience for people who don't want to pay like unlimited hearts. adds also super annoying as they force you to watch one after every lesson. do not recommend.
"4/12 the speaking lessons do not work correctly. 3/23 App still has so many issues. The pronunciation, the unnatural voices, the forced accents, the lack of oversight with answer options considering there's always multiple ways to say stuff in other languages, the lessons that don't make sense, the lessons that don't help teach anything.... Too many issues and 500 characters isn't enough for me to write a review below zero stars. Try your luck with Babbel or Rosetta Stone."
"I'm 152 into learning Japanese. Overall, it's not bad, there are times when it's frustratingly slow, and teaching me words that I'm obviously never going to use in any scenario, but I am learning from it. My biggest gripe is with how it teaches kanji, it does it completely different from anything else, and fails to explain a lot of things that would make it easier to understand and remember, but unfortunately, I also haven't come across anything else that teaches kanji much better."
"It would be great if we can interact with other user via DM or chat. So we can improve together üòÅ And I've tried the free trial for the Super one, it really so great that I want to started to subscribe, but when I going to pay, apparently it must be paid for 12 months, so I cancel it. Wish there will be option to subscribe monthly üôè"
The app is fine for learning languages however I have to give it 1 star for the crooked false advertisement of a free trial of Super Duolingo when in fact they charged me a full years subscription. Canceled immediately and contacted developer for refund which I was promptly denied. They won't be getting a single cent more from me.
"Surprisingly fun for this 60 year old who doesn't like video games in general. Nearly two years in now, I am not confident in speaking to someone, 1000 word vocabulary but unless I want to tell someone my penguin eats cake is pretty useless vocabulary. Very recently things are more complex, but the vocal prompts do not always match the choices offered. This is getting to be an issue for continuing my streak as only give errors are allowed in a lesson."
This programme enables me to learn at my own pace. The rate I get through a section depends on my ability to understand the subject matter which is varied. I do not feel under pressure if I am struggling. This style of learning creates an atmosphere which for me is conducive to learning....a first.....This suits my learning style as I am still having daily French lessons one year on....
"great lessons that slowly introduce more language with good repetition, and I love that you can see the spelling and hear proper pronunciations. can practice hearing, reading, and writing. I don't like you are penalized for getting something wrong. if you are struggling or make mistakes you lose hearts and sometimes can't move forward that day because you made 4 mistakes...which I think is kind of silly. obviously you probably need more practice"
"Nice to train a bit everyday. One really annoying thing: when you want to compete in the leagues, some players don't work at all during 5days, and then, they have the time to win 2000points and finish first or second. It does not encourage daily efforts."
"The system is good as it creates a cometition and helps motivate. What's lacking is detailed explainations of grammer. As well it allows, for example, a simplified phrase in one exercise but then in another execrise considers it wrong and expects a more formal phrase with no obvious rational reason. There is also no reason given to necessarily use one word over another when both can be used and it's then marked wrong."
"Used to be fun but recently seems to be full of people who must spend 24hrs a day on it. I cannot and get demoted to the lower league. One voice is so fast it's impossible to understand, as I struggle with some word recognition having many similar words in the choices boxes is very difficult. Again, the typing exercises are so difficult for dyslexic people, whole app seems to be against dyslexia sufferers. It has just started asking me to listen to subjects I have not even covered on home page"
"I love the way there are no lessons as such. You just work through the exercises. I'd change two things. The noises when doing speaking exercises are too loud and annoying, especially for other people in the room. Also I'd like to be able to choose what day to have happy hour. I often work Saturdays. But minor quibbles. This is fantastic. My kids love using it. And I do."
"I'm having trouble getting support from the help or repots crew. The game is malfunctioning in some lessons, and I have reported it 3 times. Responses are always the same with asking for more details, screenshots so far have not worked, but my description of the issue has been given. I think more help, because, I have been unable to continue playing because of the issues reported. I need real help, not computer generated responses."
"I have gone from conflicted to hating this app. I play every day, yet some days I start & it tells me I haven't played the day before & requires me to unfreeze it. I don't know if this is because I travel a lot & am in different time zones & it throws the app off, but it becomes so frustrating. I honestly, in 4 months, haven't learned much of anything & feel I'm wasting my time."
"(I am not native in English, please forgive me if there are any grammatically error there) I use this app to learn Finnish since more than 400 days ago. This is a nice app for beginners. Despite I use other apps for further studies after I finished the Finnish courses (quite a long time ago), I still keep practicing every day. I understand that there are not so many people speaks Finnish language, but I still hope that Duolingo can further expand the courses, mainly focus on vocabulary."
"I have used this app a lot to learn Japanese over the past year or so, but the newest update messed with a lot of my progress. A lot of courses I completed are no longer legendary status, and when I go to review them they're full of material I hadn't learned before. It'd be great if I could reset those courses so I can catch up on material fully"
"Started in 2018 but stopped around 2020. I restarted in Jan 2024. I feel it's worth paying premium to support the app. In addition, they also have a podcasts to help you hit your language learning goals. There's a competitive aspect (league boards) to help motivate people like me learn a little more every day. Bug: sometimes the XP score for the league board isn't updated or it even goes back to a previous total. So, while my two day XP count is around 2,850, my league score is only at 2,400."
It's awesome üòéüëç but like everyone else I face the same problem. After updating the app it has become slower and lags but it's legendary app #13yrold Duoelite.I hope that you add new types of interesting sections in the app. And also the highlights of this app are that it contains no ads thanks for that and it is a great learning app for kids and adults alike and for free of course.I learnt languages so fast with no difficulty.Best language and vocabulary building app in the WORLD üåéüåçüáÆüá≥ü§©ü•≥
"THIS is one of the only apps that you can learn for FREE, So if you're learning a certain Language this is the app you should use! Especially for all the noobies trying to learn a language, so i recommend this if you're learning a language. I have learned Japanese in the past 2 days and i already have a streak üòò No need to watch that many ads so i recommend!!üíó"
"A cool and fun way to learn loads of languages without prior knowledge. The app seems to focus more on how you say things than learning nouns, so you should be mindful you'll need to do that separately to get more vocabulary. I use the free version which has ads and lives, but the app makers seem very generous with ways to earn your lives back. I really like the quality of the app and would recommend it easily to anyone wanting to learn languages."
"I loved learning Hindi 15-20 minutes a day. The repetition helps it stick. That said, Duolingo is incomplete for Hindi. If you stick with it for 6 months you'll complete the entire track. It's 100% repetition after that. They don't even vary up daily review lessons. It's pretty bad. You want to keep the learning streak going, but don't want to use the app. Also lacks teaching of grammar or rules. You just have to figure it out (use Pimsleur to learn rules and more correct pronunciation)."
Super Duolingo will help you learn the fastest and progress further. The 5 heart method (in the free version) produces too much stress and you worry more about the hearts than learning. The upgrade removes that learning anxiety. I've so far been able to work on learning four different languages simultaneously. And I feel like I'm actually learning material!
I had some issues with Duolingo and I left a faily scathing review but I'm very happy to say that this issue has obviously been fixed which is great. I'm back to loving Duo again. My only thing now is - what happened to the comment option? For every answer there used to a link to a consumer feed which was so helpful bc it often provided an explanation for the answer (which Duolingo doesn't give). I'd love to see this come back
"It is DEEPLY discouraging to put in months, and months and years of daily effort only to have your entire path of progress scrambled and revamped with ""new and improved content!"" The entire concept of a gamified path is useless if the path can be rewritten at any time. I'm now facing the prospect of what feels like starting over. AGAIN. and it's honestly hard not to just quit. Especially when I cannot have any faith that my new efforts won't be wiped out in the next update."
"Changing to 3 stars for the extremely poor Ukrainian numericals speech recognition. It looks like it's not just bad but an obvious bug, like a wrong dataset. I thought it was just me, but it wouldn't even recognize my wife's speech, who is Ukrainian and this is her native language. Not a single number is recognized, even those that sound the same in russian (I an a native speaker). Overall, many other words are stressed incorrectly, and have different variants in the male and female voices."
It actually really helps. I wish there was a way for it to tell me if I'm pronouncing it the right way. Because I'll hear it and try to mimic it but I still don't know if I'm saying it correctly. Becauses that I am able to read and Write in all the different languages I'm learning! It was hard for me to get into bit once I did I really feel like I'm learning! And the leaderboards make me want to learn more and do better! Highly recommend!!!
Duolingo makes it fun and easy to learn a new language. The app does a good job of gamifying the learning and using other psychological tricks to make you stick with it. It's also fun and easy enough for my young kids to use and get excited about. I've been able to replace TV time with learning a new language time and they ask me to use it vs me making them do it
"I have been using the app for more than three years to learn Japanese. At first it was great. More recently it's gone downhill for a couple of reasons. Most importantly, the community forums are gone now. That means you don't get to hear what's currently popular in speech, and it removes interaction with people from the language. Also the explanatory lessons are now quite sparse and difficult to find so a lot of context is missing. Another problem the forums used to solve."
"It might be better to customise the studies depending on why user is studying the language. 20% of the words I am forced to learn that I dont need. For example going to school vocabulary is not reqlly needed for me but I had to go through it. Moreover, when I first reached stage 2 I was taken back to course 4 on stage 1 as you made an update which was very annoying. Recently, for some reason I was automatically moved 2 lessons ahead without any explaination. Overall, I like it. Thank you!"
"Many bugs. In btwn exercises, speaking/listening ones are turned off on its own even after turning it on again manually. No I hadn't touched the ""can't listen/speak now"" option but it smhw turns it off again! And the 2XP booster isn't always activated, just now I was completed one level and got the booster but it disappeared when I went to another lesson. Plus, it would be better if you rank normal and super users seperately, it's not a fair competition right now. Gems are also hard to gain."
"It won't update, and there are a lot of glitches lately. It didn't track my points or progress. I was moved down in the leagues because my score wasn't updated. The ""Early Bird"" and ""Night owl"" chests don't unlock during the time frames stated after doing a lesson. One listening lesson kept showing I didn't do it. I did it 3+ times until it finally updated. Lessons doesn't always complete, so the app doesn't move on to the next lesson. I've tried restarting my phone and force stopping the app."
"Great app for learning new language, but it's really frustrating they've removed the option to view all the words you've learnt. So there's no way to quicky see your progress. Seems really ridiculous. Everything is geared towards making you want to pay for super also, which I won't be, so will see how long I use it for"
"It's the best app for learning any language you wish to. It teaches you everything, scratch by scratch. Its fun and one of the most useful app i have ever downloaded. Edit: Hello! I am back to change my review, recently they have removed the discussion centre from the exercises. Since it was the only way i could get to understand the (Turkish) grammar but they changed it so i would take away 1 star from my review. Thank you."
"Duolingo is undoubtedly the best language-learning app I've ever come across. Its intuitive interface, comprehensive lessons, and interactive exercises make the language-learning journey both enjoyable and effective. Whether you're a beginner or looking to brush up on your language skills, Duolingo offers a tailored experience to suit your needs. The gamified approach keeps you motivated and engaged, while the progress tracking feature allows you to see your improvement over time. üíØ"
It's really great app. The layout is easy to navigate and user friendly. One thing I don't like. The notification are constant reminders to practice are like thorns. I have a busy day like everyone else. If I snooze the reminder notification make it longer than 30 mins before you remind me again. Maybe make them 3 or more hours between each one.
"The quality of the french course is getting worse with every update. The french being taught is often incorrect and the sentences are clunky and unnatural. It is obvious that Duo is being cheap and using AI, rather than actual speakers of those languages. I am currently a super member, but will not be renewing as I no longer trust what I am being taught."
"I am enjoying the app, but I think one easy thing that could be changed would be to include the names under the characters image in a story or conversation. I get the two characters mixed up when reading a story or conversation, because I forgot who's who. This confusion makes it hard to follow along, read, and comprehend the story, selecting the right answers as the story progresses."
Everything is fine with the app but the fact that your lessons are controlled by hearts you earn is a bit frustrating tbh since you definitely would make mistakes learning languages and when you do hearts are empty and you have to repeat the basics which i guess not everybody would like as at a point it just eats your mind and as an explorer learning languages this is personally not enjoyable as much as i do learning languages in a flow state please do sth about this.
"the app is great and all, but my issue is with the booster purchase through gems. i need there to be a confirmation pop-up that shows up whenever you want to get them (more preferable at the middle of the phone screen). this night makes it the fourth time i'm buying the 5x booster due to my annoying phone, and i'm fed up. üòï no other issue whatsoever. it's a great app!"
"very good app and materials for learning new languages. I just wish they spent more time reinforcing the vocabulary learned than introducing new one too quickly. The more lessons you do on one day, the more complex it gets as opposed to done 1 lesson one day and practice before moving on to the next lesson. Overall, it is a great resource to start learning a new language."
"The random number generator in this app is clearly inadequate. Keeps cycling selected words only, instead of the full set of words. Many sentences are weird and said in a way a human would never do, apparently are generated by a low-quality AI. It is a bit of a shame for the publisher with such a huge user base; those issues are apparently easy to fix, however they are focused mostly on the gamification and retention, rather than actual teaching."
"German, French, Dutch, Portugese really are amazing. -- Immediate closure of microphone in Android every time speaking is required: Please provide a FULL instruction on how to rectify this. We've tried everything known to date with no success. This is a serious problem!"
"It's great to learn new languages with, but lacks explanation when you get to the possessives and plurals. Other than that, it's great especially since we get to learn more languages for free (Granted there are a butt load of ads but they at least they don't interupt you in the middle of your lesson which i appreciate.) They make it competitive and to where you want to beat the others in the league. üòÖ My friends and I will go ham trying to beat everyone else out of the leaderboards."
"Don't like the last update, unnecessary gimmick added at the end of each lesson that waste three seconds each time. It's not a game, get rid of it. Even with the animation switched off in the settings, it still shows, it's very annoying. Yes you can show me the xp and time, no need for all that, I'm a superuser and I want to have the option as a paying user to not see that. Or else it's bye bye. Remove it and I remove this review."
A really good app to start off and learn any language that you're interested in learning. I'm on a 43 days streak and I'm still going on. There are a few things that are a bit wrong since I'm learning a language I should've known but sadly wasn't taught. My mom has noticed that it adds words to make the sentences more long but otherwise is teaching me good.
"I really enjoy using this app in the mornings before work. The gamification makes it a bit easier to stick with versus other methods of learning a new language. My wife and I got the Super Family Plan since we both use the app often on our phones. I think Duolingo is great for daily practice and getting the basics down. That said, I'm not sure if one can become fully fluent on Duolingo alone."
"I like the app, I own the yearly subscription, and make my relatives learn the languages hustle free. One note, though - recently, animations in my app stopped working completely. Dunno what to do. In addition, whenever I receive a double xp reward after the lesson, it's not adding up to my end result points. I noticed many bugs are happening these days"
wonderful app! although a few mistakes in the Irish for instance you could say one of the sentences two ways- but other than that! this app has helped me so much!!‚ù§Ô∏è I can't believe how good it is at every language! it even has klingon!!!‚ú®Ô∏è‚ú®Ô∏è love it and love the youtube channel very funny videos and shortsüó£ questionable moves on the YouTube channel like trying to make people scared with the kidnapping‚úãüèº but still üî• aüëÅmüëÖaüëÅzüòÅiüëçnüòçgüéâ love the little bird the logo of the app seems uh yeah.
"Everytime Duo updates , it gets worse. NOW it won't give me my double points I should have! I enjoy the,learning, but really dislike the new updates. Duo doesn't explain lessons well, so I have used the forum & Google to help me understand, but it has taken both of those away, so I am not learning sentence structure at all now. just copying what I am told. We need to forums back!"
Seriously going down hill. They ram the ad for the paid for version down your throat at every opportunity. The cost to do certain exercises tripled and now they are trying to catch you out on the speed exercises by giving almost identical words to match. Don't get me started on how awfully they teach the past tense.
"Wish they finished the Thai language course. I've been learning French with them and enjoyed the app so far, but I've read that they will not by finishing their Thai language course, which is disappointing. It seems like there would be a large number of English tourists who want to visit southeast Asia and would use a course like this so I can't understand why they would can that course."
"It's a very good app. Ads are moderaded, and they don't really disturb. My problem is the grammar in some languages. For example, in German. Even though I use properly the conjugation depending on the kasus (I don't know the word in english), it says it's wrong. Apart from that, it's a very good app. I anyways recommend to use it more as a complement than as your only way to learn a language. P.D: thanks for giving me my dog back hahaha"
Since Duolingo went public the product has reduced in quality while spiking in cost. I used to pay for super but now it's prohibitively expensive while the actual learning tools stripped down in order to push the monetization of the product. They removed great things like the forums that encouraged discussion and learning but never offered something in return. It's no longer for learning but another platform for ads and money making for investors. It's too bad it used to be a great product.
Duolingo has been very helpful for practicing Spanish. I've learned a lot. However I was getting stuck because I didn't know the grammar rules. Now I'm doing Spanish videos from YouTube as well as Duolingo and I find the two pronged approach to be very helpful. I'd really like to see Duolingo offer more grammar. Or maybe I'm not looking in the right spot. It helps so much to understand which form of a word to use. There are some very simple tools that can help a lot.
"The time on XP Ramp Up Challenge on Level 3 is way beyond ridiculous hard at this point. Especially when it comes to the +40XP part, the time is getting reduced to like 1:30. And when you can't finish it when the time is up, you have to spend more on gems to extend the time. And if you don't want to spend it, you could literally just end the session."
"Life long dream of learning Japanese, might actually come true at last. I really wish there was a way to turn off the streak, I don't care about the godamn streak or who's scaling what mountains. In addition, I want to be able to custom modify the kinda lessons I go through. I want to focus on sentence construction, and words, but I have to keep going through the alphabets, it's so frustrating."
"Doesn't teach, just throws you into guessing words til you chose right. It's pay to win (ridiculous for a lang learning app) Updates course & messes progress, whole units added that you already ""passed"" but never learned. Repetitive not in useful way, just boring. Don't use to actually learn a lang, use it like flashcards once you already started learning the lang, except it doesn't let you choose what to learn, lessons are fixed & you have to do them in order. 'Gamified' stuff just frustrating"
"User interface designed for 3-year old todlers. The app looks cute, but its overdone to a point where it is counter intuitive. Please give users an option with a less ""cutified"" and more ""to the point"" template for easy and fast navigation. Also, the Settings are not easy to find. Too many animations and notifications interupting your flow. And at the end of every speedrun, the app stalls (animations disabled in settings)."
"I really enjoy my French lessons on duolingo - I think this app is really helpful for learning another language üôÇüôÇ although there is a new feature of autocorrect and it is really annoying because I press check as autocorrect changes my answer to the ""right spelling"" so I end up getting it wrong and losing a heart üò≠üò≠ please fix this."
"Completely garbage as of last update. Keeps freezing after a question, or failing to pick up speech at all. App in general always getting worse instead of fixing old bugs. They keep doing weird irrational things like making it harder ty type rather than use the word bank (which impairs learning), they push their useless microtransaction-bait ""challenge"" a ton, and they don't fix bugs with the speech recognition that have persisted for years. The devs should be bloody ashamed."
"it used to fun and make sense. I am 305 days into learning Chinese. however they updated the course, without resetting any lessons so now I don't know which cours contain what new words, thez aren't really explained in a new way anyways. All I can do now is to repeat the gold levels and do the 3 star challenges. This really downgraded the app...."
Duolingo is useful for english learner it helps you to boast your vocabulary. This application let you have fun and more enjoyable while learning. it's more fun because you're having study while playing this application. This help me a lot because i have very limited vocabulary and phrases sometimes this application taken into thus account.
"I like it, it's good to learn languages, the only two issues I have are When I'm asked to say something in another language, and I say it bang on, but it still says to try again And whenever I need to draw a letter (for example, I learn chinese) and had to draw Âï° and it was super strict with how I draw it. For example, if I did the right part first, it would say it's wrong even though it would be correct no matter what way I draw it."
"Terrible app. Need serious fixes on their speaking exercise. And worse, they did an update making the quest for badge extremely time consuming and very unpredictable on how long the task will take. 50 quests to get a monthly badge, yet each quest demaned such extreme task such as 7 perfect lessons or another one for 8 speaking exercise(?) This is an app, not a university course. I'm not planning to sit on my phone for hours."
"For the most part it is a good app, but glitches happen. For instance I just earned 280 XP after working for quite a while. My place kept up but then after a while it suddenly dropped me all the way down to a total of 52 XP this week. Very frustrating and no way to report the glitch."
The star-ranked rapid reviews and match madness exercises need to be reworked. Their difficulty and requirements ramp up way too high to complete without needing to use a bunch of power-ups that add more time. Other than this issue I love this app. Edit (3/25/2024): the above issue still persists despite seeing updates in the course. Reduced rating from 4 to 3 stars because of this. Disappointed.
"You don't teach people how to speak new languages. You teach them how to translate words and phrases. My entire portuguese course is nothing but translate this sentence. The only time I see conversation is in the stories. Otherwise it's ""translate this sentence"". Languages is about context and standalone sentences has 0 context. And I hate the new timed extra levels on the side of the units. It's impossible to 3 star without spending gems. Which sucks for someone who is a completionist."
"I like the gamification because I'm an extremely competitive person. I also like that you have to use problem-solving to figure out what certain words and phrases mean. I have a degree in teaching English to speakers of other languages, and my students always say that learning English through immersion is very similar to what Duolingo tries to emulate through the problem-solving component. That said, you aren't going to become ""fluent"" using Duolingo. It's a good *supplement* for your study."
"The system is useful, but not great. They try too hard to push their paid service when it doesn't seem to add much value in learning a language. The way answers are scored (how words are graded and spoken) are inconsistent. And more can be done to support and encourage students in the process-the friends feature is almost worthless."
"It's a decent app, but I wish you would reduce the ai pronunciation content on the Japanese course. It's outright wrong a lot of the times, the grammar explanations are also very lacking. I wish the text was read by a human instead of the robot voice, it makes horrible mistakes and some letters like Chi vs Shi vs Ki are virtually indistinguishable to my ear when the A. I. is reading it. Please use more humans for a higher quality experience."
"Very easy to use. Customised tips for correcting mistakes, and I love the daily reminders. Would be great if they popped up with a ding as notifications though. Also the different characters/voices are good for practical learning. Enjoying the app so far."
"Stop giving us 6 to 8 xp when it's supposed to provide you 20 to 40 xp. It's super infuriating. There's also some words where you can't even translate without having the proper keyboard for it. Also, some of these courses are way too short and don't even provide the learning that everything comes with the languages, numbers, alphabet, etc... especially when we're paying over $100.00 a month for plus, and we don't even get full access to learn the entire language. Please fix this!!!"
"It's unbelievable, years later still missing the feature to grab and drag words to reorder them within a sentence. Each time you forget a word which belongs to the beginning of the sentence, you can't simply add the word and drag it where it belongs in the sentence. Somehow this works in the web version but not in the app."
"I have been learning Spanish for 4 years using Duolingo and counting. It motivates me every day to learn because of its reward system. Sometimes it's repetitive but it's build like that to ingrain the language in our brain. If you really want to speak a language however, you should choose to join the Duolingo online events with human teachers."
"I downloaded this a bit over a year (?) ago to learn French, and its helped me quite a bit. I can read French a lot better the speak it (but I'm still learning) . I'm also learning Dutch as well, as it's linguistically similar/close to English. If you want to start a new language, this would be a good steppingstone. Have a notebook when you start, to write down any tips that pop up during your lessons and any new words you learn. Just wish Estonian was an option too!"
"duolingo is great to learn a language but sometimes when I earn xp it doesn't add the amount that they told me I was going to get and also right now I am in the Ruby league and I noticed that there are people that aren't learning Spanish like me, what ment is that there are some languages that are easier than others and vice versa. I love that they keep repeating the old things that we learn like that we don't forget it even though it seems annoying and it didn't give me super but I paid for it"
"Taken a real downturn since the recent update which changed all the modules. I was instantly thrown into grammar nightmare tests which I hadn't been taught yet. Yes it may be a better up to date module but it has thrown the current users in the dirt. I can't get through a single ""lesson"" (very loose use of word, unless you pay premium you get kicked out the 'class' after you run out of 5 lives, and left not learning anything at all) I really wish I could get the money back I threw into this."
"1. Good but doesn't really help you learn a language. ""The fastest way to learn a language"" is not true! 2.as always, it is better on iOS. Example: It only has Duolingo max, music and maths on iOS 3.When I tap the view friend quest button, it doesn't work. It just takes me to the quest section. PLEASE FIIIIXXX!! 4. The motto ""By spending 15 minutes a day on Duolingo, U can learn a language! What can 15 mins of social media do?"" Yea whaaat can it do!? Make u addicted ofc..."
"Great apl for learning a different language. Do have some options on what you can learn. I don't use the speaking ones. I wish the app would get rid of the spelling ones as those tend to get me messed up. Can't spell when typing regularly, let alone a foreign language. It's not a bad app, though. Change some things and give people more options on exercises they do."
I really like the interactive conversations they've added. I would love to see them more. I also like the linear track and that it lets me skip to any section. I just wish there was a way to choose more vocabulary. I feel like I review such a small list of words. Updating my review to say I love these super cute and funny listening exercises and the Duo widget.
"I really enjoy duolingo but for the past few weeks the app has slowed WAAAAYY down. If you're trying to compete in the tournaments, time is an asset. Each of the Speak exercises that add XP points slows down to a CRAWL taking 1.5 to 2 MINS to complete vs the 45-55 SECONDS I usually clock. I've tried reaching out via Feedback in the app several times but only getting auto email reply. App is fully updated, RAM is cleared. Really hope you reply and fix this .. I will update when theres a fix"
"The app works well, except it no longer gives me any rewards. If I complete a lesson without enough experience points to open a chest the ad will play. If I do a second lesson to open a chest the app freezes. When I quit and reopen the app (after waiting 2 to 3 minutes of perpetual loading following the lesson) it shows I've reached the points for the chest, but my gems haven't changed and I don't have another streak freeze. I'm pretty much perpetually stuck."
"Practice (repetition) is essential to remember words but that's only available with the paid version. Poor structure for teaching grammar, tenses & conjugation. Other than that, you pick it up over time, it does what it says. Paid App is great, free I'd likely drop in time."
"I enjoy duolingo and what it offers. Without premium, you can still learn whatever language you want, too. With premium, however, there are no ads, and you get unlimited hearts. The annoying thing is running out of hearts. You are trying to learn a language, and when you get stopped because you run out of hearts. I've learned a lot from duo. However, I feel like you have to be tutored or be in a language class to get everything. Duo doesn't explain everything. Especially conjagating verbs!!"
"Thank you for fixing the past error regarding the practice. When I entered yesterday to the app, it notified me that the Mandarin course was updated, then I make a new lesson and it shows me the same characters that I saw three exercises ago; however, the fact that when I wanted to practice to win hearts, I got characters that I never learned and that the app marked my answer wrong because I don't know them, that is unfair. Could you do me a favour and tried to fix that error please? Thank you."
"The lessons are fairly easy, and you do learn quickly. I'm not really sure how accurate some of the words and phrases actually are because they don't match up with google or bing translate programs. Also, to be in constant competition with other learners is boring and distracting from why you want to learn a language."
"Good business model and a really bad app. Try something else before you advance too far and can't leave it (ie. their business model). Most frustrating app ever. Sooo many bugs and sooo little bug fixing. New! They removed community added content, which helped us learn more than the app itself. I have reported dozens of mistakes in the last 3 years, and they fixed maybe 3."
"If you use the paid for version or the free one you are still only dabbling in the language. I Would prefer that each language had its own points and hearts system, having one for all is disheartening. The app makes you learn lots of irrelevant things repetetively. It is not conversational at all, it is fairly usless at giving you a grounding or background or confidence in the language. But is user friendly and fun. So thats ok then."
"It's a great app for learning. I am currently learning Italian because some lines in one of the books I read are Italian. It's great and I love the speaking exercises. My only complaint is that the widget is a bit glitchy. Like, on the app it will say I have a 138 day streak but when I look at the widget it will say 136 or something. Not that much of a difference, but it's still there. Other then that, I love the app!"
Everything in this app is good for learning languages. But one of the worst thing i saw while learning korean. That the guide book is not well designed. Now i am in the unit 3 lesson 1. In this unit i saw a bunch of new words. But the words are not written in the guide book. I wish you will fix this for every units if they have this problem. Another one is the audio. Some audios are not clear and accurate as well as they should. I will update my review once all this issues are fixed.
"Nice, and free. But sometimes it is a little frustrating when your doing lets say a unit review and your told to translate a word you have never seen before even after completing the full unit. Same goes for the star courses its just annoying when you've completed the course in question yet when you do the star speed trial there are words that weren't in the unit... (wouldn't be a problem if the word was purple) But regardless this is a good app just a few annoying kicks every now and then."
"Learning Finnish, it was harder than other languages (e.g. no explanation ever) but I liked it. I even paid for the extra. And after 1,000 words and barely scratching the surface of the language (e.g. the only past tense word is ""was"") it was over and the daily tasks just got increasingly boring because of repetition. Why not teach more? At least new words maybe? Or at least not the same 20 sentences... ...now I know those sentences by heart. I din't even need to check the original to know."
"In the beginning, I thought the speed was too slow for my progression, but after I patiently took several courses, I realized it's actually the perfect speed for me to learn. Really love it. Recommend download it. Oh, and if you really want to enjoy the learning, you should pay for the super, which is really not what I like but necessary for me to stay engaged."
"Although the app has improved dramatically in terms of how it teaches Japanese and allows you to practice what you have learned, the problem of forced engagement and burnout has also gotten a lot worse. They keep raising the goalposts for both daily quests and monthly challenges, and it really gets in the way of learning. Fix these problems and the app would be stellar! Also, I would really love to see Ch'orti, Yucatec, Nahuatl, Mvskoke, Ainu, Louisiana Creole, and Cajun added."
"5 stars for the old app 3 stars for the updated version. The new update seems to be geared at getting more plus members. Penalizing mistakes by deducting hearts is pointless‚Äîit makes us *fear* making mistakes and that completely defeats the purpose of learning a new language! And the ads? I get you're trying to advertise Duolingo plus, but we don't need to see the same ad after every lesson to get the point. (I've been using Duolingo for over 2 years and so far it has helped me a lot)"
"I just love it everything is good in it ..no bugs ,no problems ,no ads!! It's a fun learning game in which u can learn languages in a fun way. it's a perfect app for learning ü©∑.. u can learn as much as languages u want ! I'm learning japanese and I'm getting quite good at speaking so this app definitely deserves 5 stars üåü..there might be 1 ad coming but it doesn't affect the learning cause its not too much disturbing and the 1 ad if for getting super duolingo so we can learn better!"
"Duolingo is definitely one of the best ways to learn a language, because it works on a very specific learning aproach when it never stops challenging you. The opportunity to advance through the leagues is the best side of this app, because it doesn't only teach you a language. It keeps you entertrained and motivated to earn xp as well, which makes this app stand out above the other ways of learning."
"I'm a long time user but I haven't like the heart system. You can only make 5 mistakes? That's insane and really discouraging for people who want to learn. And paying for it isn't in my list of financial priorities. Edit - new update switched up all the lessons for me, disappointed again. At this point I'm just logging in to continue my 2+ year streak."
"I have the premium, and its very nice! Not being afraid of being penalized for making a mistake really helps. I'm learning Mandarin currently, and they just added a writing practice for characters, which is very nice. They also updated the learning course... which is fine, but I wish they took into account that theres now a bunch of words that are in previous lessons that I haven't learned yet, that show as me having learned them already."
Amazing app ! I totally love it. It helps me learn languages easily. I am able to speak other languages faster than regular self learning apps/contents. It's very interactive and nudges you to learn which I typically don't like but this motivates me to continue the streak and learn everyday !
"A great app to learn the basic of languages. For example, I'm currently learning Japanese and it is going rather smoothly. I'm using the free version, and it still works out alright. I just dislike how we can't access things that could help benefit our learning, since you need to pay for it. Nonetheless, amazing app."
"Free (with ads) but of limited benefit. *For* Linearly structured learning. Repetitive drills. Help in reading, listening, and a little writing. *Against* Exercises: language very unnatural. Exercises: lack coherence. Useless words repeated ad nauseam (e.g. pingouin, trousse). Mistakes: many of my Italian corrections were accepted. French version is more obstinate; many of my evidently correct answers were marked incorrect. You won¬¥t learn language using Duolingo alone."
"An excellent app for all stages of learning a language. My only criticisms are that American English and their way of grammar is required to answer some questions correctly. Also, I am learning Spanish and they are teaching pesos as the Spanish currency which obviously hasn't been active in Spain itself since 2002. I expect this is because of the American countries that still use pesos. This needs to be taught more clearly to avoid potential confusion."
"I have been learning German for just over a year. For the most part, the app is really good, but it needs to be used alongside another learning method (classes, etc). My one frustration is that sometimes I am not sure about the answers, so end up guessing. The app tells me I am ""Awesome"", but in reality, I am not sure about my answer. I would rather it showed be the phrase in both English and German in the pop-up box for every question."
"This is a great app as a supplementary resource for learning a foreign language. I started on the free plan with ads, but I then moved to the paid plan without ads, and it is so worth it. The app uses the Common European Framework (CEF) to describe the language proficiency levels (i.e. A1-C2), which is very useful. And the app has an excellent user interface as well. Kudos to the designers and developets, great work!"
"Tried for 1 week and made significant progress, but im completely unable to use the voice features as it doesn't work on my Galaxy Note 20 Android. I've tried everything on my own to resolve, but no use. I would give 5 stars, but for the reliance on Google voice features. Sadly, I received no assistance from the Help team although I submitted 2 tickets. It's still usable without the voice features, but missing the satisfaction of having some perfect lessons."
"Super sub is worth it. Cute design that really helps you learn and retain a new language. The latest update lets you see words you learned! Super happy!! The notes can be a bit disorganized, but I negate this problem by taking my own notes. There are a lot of things I love about this app. It's the only language course I've stuck to, I've found most language programs to be super dry and boring. Duolingo's gamification of language learning works for me!"
I have now completed a 360 +streak May I make some suggestions 1. Very important ommission is that there is very little grammar explanation. It will help a lot if the learner would know why some prefixes change 2. With AI it would be nice to interact with vocally. I get no opportunity to speak the language I am learning I have reduced my rating to three stars. THERE IS NO COMMUNICATION FROM THE DEVELOPERS. No Grammer assistance. Even posting or email is ignored
No explanations for why your answer was not correct in most circumstances which means you don't learn the language so much as you learn which phrases duolingo likes. There is no flexibility in what you want to learn because each language only features one linear path to follow. More flexibility and more explanations would improve my motivation and ability to learn a language and make this app better.
"the streak mechanic is wildly stressful. there was no way to get an extended pause to my streak when i was literally the sickest i have ever been in my life and i don't like an app punishing me for having REAL ailments. everytime i have lost a streak, it was because i was battling illness or struggling with disabilities. being consistent every single day is hard, you shouldn't have to spend 500 gems every damn time. what happened to the challenge that appeared instead? i liked that"
"I've been doing Japanese on and off for years now, but really started taking it seriously this time. The app is great and I understand why there's ads after each lesson, honestly would just buy super because that's also great. I do think the leaderboards are a little unbalanced with everyone learning a different language at a different level, some people are way too advanced for it to be fair. My issue is, the words I was given in my Japanese lesson did not match what the voice was saying."
"Such an awesome app for learning languages! my kids and I really enjoy using this app. This is one of the apps I am willing to pay for in order to learn something for life. My kids are learning several languages and we learn so much more about other cultures. We enjoy the challenges this app provides, and keeping our streaks going, using boosters and collecting gems to use on boosters to help climb leaderboards, it's absolutely fun and we all learn!"
I have come to represent the reddit users trying to learn latin. They say that the app has a great ground work for latin in the first half of the coarse but then rushes through in the second half. It is also very short and uses English grammer rather than latin grammar. It doesn't teach past or future tense. I think you should expand the coarse to teach the language better and create 2 courses. for latin with a modern take and one with a classic take. It's a good it just need to be better
"The efficiency of learning words decreased tragically. With this new stile and linear learning line I don't have the choice anymore if I want to continue with another lecture. When I start a new lecture the picture-word connection is always the last ant the lecture need from me tu understand the new word immediately from writing. Please bring back the old app, or give me the possibility to downgrade this app, because I don't like the new stile and lecture organization."
"good app. it lets you listen, write and learn new words (im learning chinese) but the one thing i don't like is after every single lesson there is an advertisement about super duolingo, i feel like i watched it so many times, i feel like i memorised the advert word for word."
"My daughter was using Duolingo to learn French. I love the idea of it and at first it was working fine. When she reached the Sapphire league she kept getting the answer right but it was marked as wrong! At first I thought it was the grammar (capitalisation/full stops) but even when her answer was identical in every way - EXACTLY the same wording, spelling, accents, grammar, etc. - it was still being marked as the wrong answer. She became very disillusioned and uninstalled it which is a shame."
great experience i started last month and i have done pretty good progress small bit sized tests and i would like to suggest the developers to add mic communication system so that the people could talk fluently . It would be very helpful to us .Overall this app is better than any other language learning apps üôÉüôÉlove it üíö
"Update: two less stars as Music and Math are not available on Android Duolingo seamlessly blends fun and efficiency. Its user-friendly interface and gamified elements create an engaging learning adventure. Intelligent spaced repetition ensures optimal retention, adapting to individual progress. Highly recommended for a rewarding journey into language learning. Useful for beginners to intermediate levels."
"I've started learning Spanish a few years ago with Duolingo, it was nice and I had to complement with resources outside the app . needless to say I forgot a lot but the new version, with more gamification and a lot of new features is amazingly complete. (a bit stressful sometimes with the timing)"
"I really like duolingo, but I am starting to think that maybe it won't teach me the whole language, because you don't really progress much, you only learn about 200 words in your first section. One thing, also the stories don't really teach you anything, so I don't know why they put it into duolingo in the first place. Don't get me wrong it's great. But I think it could do with a tiny bit more improvement. Also once you start a course there is no going back, I accedentally chose Welsh."
"Duolingo is a pretty good learning tool, my only suggestions are that they teach more useful and simple conversion at first like ""Hey, how are you"" and ""I'm doing fine, and you?"" for simple back and forth conversion. Also I'd suggest that they add more complex languages such as Thai and Cantonese, I really wanna learn Thai and with the tools in Duolingo it wouldn't be difficult if only they had that language as an option :( anyways, pretty good app"
"I love this app. The way it is structured to learn is really good for many learning styles. There are pictures, matching games, and speech portions so if you are a visual learn or prefer to read it has a good blend. The free version is wonderful if you're okay with a few ads but I am definitely considering trying the paid version for all the added benefits it has."
"First of all I'll say it's the best and only language translating and teaching app I adore it's amazing ü§© and I just can't get enough but unfortunately I got enough when I saw that sometimes there might be a glitch or s typo in my experience and don't get me started on the case of the legendary boost it doesn't always work out for me if I try it's either I get disconnected or get refreshed or maybe if I just log out for a quick second , come back I am off and my gems go with it."
"Progression is WAY WAY WAY too slow sometimes. It should let me skip levels in a unit. However, Duolingo has been very helpful in getting me better at Spanish and more familiar with the language. BUT I also don't like how we don't have the option most of the time to type out the translations instead of clicking/tapping the little blocks with the words. I hate it, ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M DOING IT ON PC. I prefer typing and I want for there to be ALWAYS the option to type. PLEASE ADD THAT!!!"
"Worked great for about a month, then progress stopped being recorded in one of my languages and my streak stopped being maintained despite completing lessons. Given I can't progress in one language, and the game-ification for motivation isn't working, what's the point in using the app over other language courses? I pay for super duolingo, and submitted a bug report yesterday but received an automated message and no solutions. 2 stars because I can progress in one language with no streak."
"Great app to learn new languages on! Has many motivational fetures that keep you going! One thing I noticed that isn't quite what I wanted is that they don't actually teach you what endings apply to what sircumstances for romance languages (or i just haven't gotten there yet), so you have to pay extra attention to the patterns of when and where they use specific endings."
"I have been using super (subscription) dor a year now and have been enjoying using the app. I do have a complaint though, there seems to be a glitch with speaking exercises, it does not recognise words sometimes even though im pronouncing it exactly as instructed , even cutting me off mid sentence sometimes with a 'lets move on' even though I am still mid sentence. Sometimes i am done saying the sentence and it will just lag and only after some time ask if I would like to try again. FRUSTRATING!"
"really good for beginners, but keep the streak, or you'll forget everything you learned. also love the parts when you actually say the words to make sure you are learning. also asking where you are in Spanish! by the way, not a fake review, just a happy guy in his Marilly way."
"Love the app. The widget feature was what has been helping me keep on my streak.... but now, I am kind of annoyed by the widget not regularly updating the images as often as it used to. About two weeks ago, I have to click and open the app in order to have the image update. And it is kind of demotivating."
it's amazing I love it soo much. it's such a great app I 100% recommend. the ads are what you want them to be they are like every 5 to 10to even 20 mins and it really did help me learn a little of JapaneseüáØüáµ. although I don't believe any app of any kind can teach like to speak any language fluently without someone talking to you that is experienced. I think this is an amazing app. and if you're looking to download it.. YOU 100% SHOULD! ! ‚ú®(I hope this helped)
"Opened my phone and found that the widget I installed was not functioning correctly. So I log in on my tablet instead, and find that my streak has not been registered for the past FIVE days. Had it not been for the multiple freezes I owned, my 400+ day streak would be gone. Please fix this issue ASAP."
"Audio levels between the app and the ads need to be adjusted. I tend to play at night after everybody else has gone to bed, it's incredibly frustrating to try listening to a lesson and then have an ad play at five times the volume."
When starting out Duolingo (Italian> it keeps you at the SAME questions for way too long. To try and skip ahead with quiz almost works but they throw in one word you don't know & it keeps you there . I have answered the same questions 100 times successfully & then they continue with the same questions even as level up. makes me nott want to log on. However when I did French at a higher level it moved faster. and gave NEW knowledge and challenged me Instead of wasting my time .
"As of writing this review, I have a 1080 day streak running. I've used this app to help with Spanish classes, brush up on Polish, and more recently, learning Japanese. The app is great at reviewing grammar and its applications within sentences, but I found it to be tedious when it comes to vocabulary learning. The lessons are very repetitive, and you go a while before learning new vocab. I would absolutely recommend using this app with other vocab learning apps, like Anki."
Update: I used this app daily for almost two years and made a lot of progress but after the last update no matter how much progress I make the next day it kicks me back to a previous level. I have done the same lessons over again for over a week. If the next update doesn't fix it I will stop using this app. Too bad because I really liked it when it worked I love this app! I have made so much progress in just 15-30 minutes a day!
"I like the app, but I do think that it's not good on it's own. I do French in school so I use the app to learn some extra vocab and help me with some revision, but I see people learning languages on here unsupported and I just don't know if that would work. The pronunciation features are very buggy and just not the best. But I do like the leaderboard and streak aspects to it. Also it's not the nicest user experience if you're not willing to pay for Super."
This is a great app. The marketing and Social media team really pulls through and it's a great way to learn a new language. It is slightly harder if you don't get Duolingo Super but I think it's a reasonable price if you can pay it. Even if you don't it's still a great way to learn I've learned so much in just 2 months. I wish they would add sign language though.
This really helps me get motivated with everything. The freaking notifications are f****** hilarious. I love this app. It really helps me get motivated during the day if I start getting motivated then. I would get motivated to do other stuffand this makes me very happy. I'm very happy that this app exist. And I want it to keep producting and keep adding on to how grad it already is. But there is a bit of a problem with the ADS for me. It's just a little bit too much. Other than that this is nice
"I just love it when they cha ge the course most of the way through. Sat down to finish a level review and the thing is asking me vocabulary and grammer I've never seen before. Ai content is bad. Voice lines are mid at best. I wanted to stick it out and finish the course but since they've pulled the rug on me here I'm not keen on that. There are better apps, I'd reccomment Hello Chinese if you're looking at Mandarin."
"I have the paid version, learning Japanese & Chinese. It's quite good overall but I think there are too many revision exercises that are based on speed and not enough to entrench the vocabularies. There are no speaking exercises in Japanese (up to S2) and in Chinese, there are quite a few voice / speaking exercises that do not work. There are no writting exercises. Some exercises don't make sense e.g. a 6 years old university student?"
"The lessons are good but the app has bugs in either its design or implementation. It keeps sending me backwards to repeat the same lessons, claiming that it's ""synched my progress to new and improved content."" I wouldn't mind if the content was new but it's exactly the same."
"- Very well though through, nice to use. Many addictive mechanics used to make you continue (xp, league, legendary chest, gem systems) - waste of time, waaaaay too many repetitive basic sentences all the way to the end. - I'd love more theory before practice (approx none currently). - The free version is unusable: excessive 'gem', 'heart' dependency, frequent ads... - A few bugs, especially on a spotty connection (eg. lags on lesson validation, or even crash and lesson not marked as done)"
"Good for practicing vocab, of you don't pay the explanations are lacking and in order to learn the language you must do a significant amount of outside research just to understand the lessons and why things are said a certain way. Additionally, there are many glitches, for instance the ""spend gems to get more double XP"" feature is broken, and several times my 5th early bird chest and night owl chests just glitch and don't give double XP, which is frustrating since the leagues motivate me."
"it is so fun I've been doing it for almost 2 years (nonstop, but I've used a ton of streak freezes on days where I didn't have internet access) and it goes well with my Spanish class. it feels like it reinforces the things I learn in class and let's me learn a few extra things as well. recommended to anybody who is taking Spanish in school especially"
"This app would be better if you could choose to reuse/customize parts of the lessons. Like the character writing practice, or choosing which vocab you need help on, etc. It tries to tell you which words/things you need help on, but the lessons often skip vocab you learned earlier until the very end, so the program doesnt have mistakes on record to flag those words. The lessons are too likely to just randomly repeat stuff, and not go over everything evenly"
"Good idea and realisation, if you want to pick up a new language, you can try this app first, it will give you a taste of the language and give you basic vocabulary which will be useful if you decide to take a proper course later. Since recently there is a problem with the app where the app freezes once the timer runs out during rapid review. Once this is fixed I will give the app 5 stars."
"I really like learning languages but it's sometimes unfair to me lately. It's because I am literally Deaf and I often see that they try to get me to practice any audio lessons. I wish that there's a switch ""no"" on all audio lessons/tasks for deaf learners to pick for future lessons. It's really annoying to see them trying to get me to practice it."
"this is an amazing app that let's you learn many languages but it doesn't have all of them. For example, my mother language, tamil is not in it. It even has fictional languages but it does not have the Minecraft enchantment table language. Also, the prices for duolingo premium is too expensive, at least in my opinion. Everything else is amazing though."
"This app is amazing for anyone to learn the language they desire but the thing is the older version was better than this where the topics were divided into 6 levels or so and each level had a crown. That version was, according to me, best. And we could practice the previous lessons but that option is not available anymore in this newer version I'm dissapointed with this new version"
"It used to be five stars but having used every day for three years I'm changing it to four. They have done several major updates which in my opinion makes learning a new language more difficult. There used to be more tips and explanations for the grammar used before each lesson, but that's gone. User comments used to be really helpful when you don't understand why an answer is formed like that, but they have taken them out completely and provicded no alternative."
"Almost a year of using the app religiously and I can categorically say that this will NOT teach you another language adequately enough on its own. You may remember small sections here and there but it is just not effective enough especially when you are struggling with a word having like 5 different spellings, it just watches you struggle and offers no clarification. You can't even look up a word for explanation. This app has existed for so long and it's still this bad. I am a paid member."
"I removed 4 stars for one very aggravating reason. I've been working on my Chinese course for awhile, I was well into unit 3. After updating, the units have been completely changed. Most of what I learned is gone & the units I completed are full of things that I never learned. Essentially, I'm starting over from the beginning since the units are full of things I haven't actually learned. Not cool & not making me want to continue using this app. I'm so glad I didn't cave and pay for Super..."
"Great for reading. Only good for speaking if you repeat everything, repeat everything! Not great for writing. Helps with listening but it has silly characters with silly accents. Even so, I'm learning new vocab and grammar and hopefully I'm retaining at least some of it."
"I assume they have their reasons, but the order in which I an learning words seems weird. For example, I've been learning over two months and only just seeing numbers 1-2 but had already learned the Hungarian for secretary and engineer.... Overall I am enjoying learning though"
"The app makes learning a new language fun. The only thing I don't like is that there is a heart system which you have 5 hearts and everytime you get a question wrong you lose a heart. If you lose all your hearts you can do a lesson to gain one back or use 250 diamonds to gain all back. If you don't want to have 5 hearts you could get Super Duolingo which gives you infinite hearts, but I think the subscription is pretty expensive for learning a language. The rest of the app is great though."
"I love Duolingo. It's a slow pace, but i am actually getting somewhere with a language i have tried to learn for a long time. You have to get past the first 5 units and then it starts comming together. Relax, have fun, learn-forget-learn, try not to burn out. Remember, this is supposed to be fun and enjoyable. It takes a couple years of daily study to learn a language."
"The free version is very helpful, but it does have an ad between every lesson, which can get a bit annoying. However, I've been practicing so much that they just gave me 3 days Plus. I didn't even have to put in my card info. You definitely need to put in practice with real speakers, but I've used this app since 2016 and always found it to be engaging and educational."
"Designed simply to take your money. If you don't have the Premium version you will get arbitrary questions with multiple answers so you waste your lives. I do no advise this predatory pricing scheme Edit: I was angry when I wrote this, I'd had a bad day and when it got to the end of the day Duolingo popped up to remind me I needed to do a lesson to continue my streak. It gave me nice chilled lesson just to practice my skills and not trick me so I could continue my streak. It made me feel good"
"It's a good app and makes it super easy to learn a language but constantly sends you super annoying notifications if you don't practice for a couple days like... "" Duo thinks your ignoring him!"" etc. and doesn't let you play for a while if you run out of gems. It also, shows you too many ads of Super Duolingo which can get irritating. However, it's a good app ,but could use improvement."
"It's a very good app for learning languages. But, there are so many things you have to pay money for. It definitely would have gotten 5 if you didn't have to pay for SO MUCH. Also, there definitely are some significantly better apps for learning languages. Those other apps wouldn't cost money. But for some things I like about this app are that you get streaks and when you get a high streak (I have a 44 day streak) you feel like you have to do another lesson to continue your streak! That's It!"
"This app would be useful if it didn't cram 60 second long unskipable adds in-between each session. Then it has the balls to try and guiltrip you into doing lessons by sending extremely annoying notifications and reminders telling you how bad you are for not dedicating 23 hours a day to practice whatever langue you want to learn. This app is bait, they make the free experience extremely miserable in hopes to get you to pay for the upgraded version."
"*Update - 18 Feb 2024: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix the stupid bug that is causing the app to not detect voice properly. This issue started since 2 updates ago. I had to change my review because like many others, I learned a lot in the beginning, but the app suddenly updates and changes the course material in the midst of a lesson. The hints aren't as accurate as they used to be, so phrasing the context of a sentence becomes more difficult. Lithuanian is also not offered in this app, why?"
"Enjoyable learning experience. Worst part is completing a lesson earlier in the day is not counted if you start a lesson from a reminder notification later in the day. So, there is only a record of one lesson completed, not two. Has happened many times now, so getting super frustrating. Ads annoying but tolerable. Would be great if they added the Maori language."
"Okay I'm still giving a five star review but I've noticed that for quite some time now, after every lesson, the connection goes away and it'll tell me that I'm offline, even when I'm not. And I have to turn off the app and turn it back on. It's getting annoying, I wish that bug can be fixed soon as possible. Thanks."
"Duolingo has chronic mistakes in the English translation as for example saying ""use to"" instead of USED TO in Spanish lessons learning past tense. Also, the use of coger instead of tomar, constantly using isn't, won't, didn't instead of is not, will not, did not etc. Also there is no way to review old topics because the app keeps erasing and changing what unit I'm on and no clue what's coming up. The ""tips"" never explain new things very well. I use this app to supplement my learning Spanish."
"I've now finished all 3 sections of Haitian Krey√≤l and am on the refresher section. I've learned about 600 words total. It is the same few sentences ad nauseum! I just use predictive text to complete the typed ones. When I do a Legendary level that incorporates some of the other material, I find I can't remember it because it's not being reviewed. Duolingo has mass fired translators and is now AI generated. There are SO MANY mistakes. Duolingo uses us as beta testers to catch these mistakes."
"It's a good enough app to learn, but there are certainly some problems. It would tell me I wasn't pronouncing certain words right, even when I got a *native speaker* to say those exact words. And there are challenges - especially ""Matching Madness"" - that will be timed, yet rely heavily on vocabulary the app hasn't even given yet. Also the difference in their premium and standard services is like night and day."
"Not fond of the baiting icon changes. I don't care for the constant focus on leaderboards, streaks, or the weird characters talking to me. The app also lacks a general integrated dictionary if you wish to privately study the language further and other useful independent lessons. It's more game than education."
Pretty good when using the paid version! The free version is unfortunately hampered by unskippable ads after every single lesson (so every (2-5 minutes) and not being able to make more than 5 mistakes without spending the in-app currency. The ads are not as prominent the first week or so of using the app.
"I'm not a big fan, I paid for a year so i am doing a lesson every day but find it will take forever to learn on this app. The app really doesn't ""teach""much. There is a tiny ""guide"" at each section you have to locate & review yourself but other than that its the same sentences & content with no explanation or theory, over & over. It will keep bugging you about rankings & has annoying race against the clock type activities. Mondly is infinitely better."
"it's an amazing app and it's been doing so well until recently, it keeps saying ""you're offline"" meanwhile I'm not and I'm not having issues with other apps just this app. what can I do about it? please, rectify it. edit: I just tried uninstalling and reinstalling and now I can't even log in due to the same error. what a bummer, it was a nice app Edit: it's been three months and the app is still not working, it keeps saying I'm offline. I wrote a mail to them back in January and no response."
"I am here on google store after having duolingo in my phone for 6 months to tell that duolingo is slowly deteriorating. It has been asking for premium for everything and without it, it has limited our actions to just doing as scheduled and it is a bit less fun now. I hope this doesn't become like other apps such as spotify. But, still I am giving this app 4 stars because it is actually good for learning."
"The course I am following changed order whilst I was part way through but the words learnt did not update. Too much time is spent teaching names when more time could be spent on learning grammar. No explanations for common mistakes: genders, pluralisations, word order and so on. It definitely feels like the language with lower uses are an after thought."
"Duolingo is great, especially the fact there's a free version. But it's SERIOUSLY lacking in features. How there isn't a flash card section to easily practice vocabulary is mind blowing to me. Apparently this was discussed as a feature and never executed, quite dissapointing really."
"Everything was fine until the app had an update two days ago. My previous lessons had been all but wiped clean, and then when I retook said lessons, I was given completely new terms, phrases, and sentences that I've never learned. It didn't even reset the lessons to the actual learning points. Basically said, ""Hey, we've updated your lessons, have fun learning!!"" But all my data is gone!!!!"
"Within 10 minutes I was reminded why I ditched this app 10 years ago. Useless, repetitive lessons about letters. No sense of progress or excitement. I said I want to use it for travel so why am I being forced to match sounds to single letters over and over and over again? Tried French before and all it seemed to want to teach me was ""The children are eating rice."" Brilliant. That'll come in handy for a multitude of situations. Ignorance is preferable to this garbage."
"Excellent experience. I'm learning Russian and it ""was"" going good. But now ever since Unit 3 and the end of Unit 2 it has been spitting out billions of new words and putting them in hard combinations. It's good practice but now I have a lack of motivation because of it. Before I was 10-15 minutes per day. Now I am 5 minutes per day. Beside that it is perfect üëå."
"the app used to be really good but they have removed so many features! you can't see the questions others have asked for similar mistakes. if there's a concept you don't understand there isn't anywhere in the app to look up more information. you used to be able to have ai chats in the language for practice that they removed. when there is a drop down for word selections, they don't tell you why there are multiple options underneath and there is no tutorials that explain it ahead of time."
"gamified language learning to make learning languages less onerous. it's obsession over daily practice gets a little annoying (especially when you're a busy adult), but streak freezes ease that somewhat. I think the $70 annual membership to avoid ads is worth it. It's a nice alternative to learn something rather than doom-scrolling Facebook."
"Frustrating since my last update. The app keeps telling me I'm offline when I'm not. Somehow, in my offline state I can still redo former levels. It's frustrating. Then there's the shutting off when I'm in the middle of a class. Please fix this."
"So far, the app itself seems great. But the ads are intrusive, sudden, and LOUD. Really ruins the whole experience. Quiet down your ads, or default them to mute, and maybe I'll add more stars. The app also advances through screens without me hitting the ""continue"" button."
"It's fun to play the Duolingo games and it helped me learn vocabulary and some basic sentence structures. However, after one year, I still find it challenging to integrate everything I've learned and bring what I've learned into everyday conversation, so I think there's room for improvement"
"This app is stellar! However, I feel like some parts of the app could use improvement, such as the usage of more realistic words and phrases and more hard, complex sentences that I'd use in real life. Otherwise the app is fun and engaging! :D"
"I really enjoyed using this app and found it to be a great learning experience for learning French. Now I'm in the position where I've been scammed out of 56‚Ç¨, I was offered two weeks free super duo and told I'd be notified two days before these two weeks ended (which I wasnt) then next thing I know without notification I was charged for a whole year plan, not a month. I tried to get a refund through the Google Play Store only hours after I was charged but they declined my refund, scam"
"I have used Duo for a few years to learn Spanish. Its been ok but very limited conversation practice, but adequate vocab practice. What i dont like is the 'nagging' and lack of new examples. Also, the app is too perfectionist for someone wanting simple conversation skills regardless of perfection. I think helpful conversation is give-n-take, asking clarifying questions and being flexible\foregiving. Instead of the leaderboard, i would prefer a friendly avatar inviting me to a conversation..."
"This app started out great, but they don't explain why or in which situations sentences are strutted differently so I have to learn via trial & error. Also lately, they've been teaching sentences that just aren't used in day-to-day life. I've heard Duolingo got rid of their translators and are now using AI. If that's true, I'm looking elsewhere cause nothing I try to learn here will be helpful"
"I've been learning Êó•Êú¨Ë™û on Duo for quite a while , and it's actually incredible . First of all , there's no downsides of using it , secondly it actually helps you remember not so niche words and sentences with repetition and It just keeps getting better with every update . Although I'd recommend using Duo as more of a lil daily lang practice session than using it as your only source of knowledge , still pretty cool for maintaining a habit though. Ganbatte !!"
"It's pretty cool when you get that sudden realization that you are beginning to understand another language, but after more than 3 years of everday app use, I have become disgusted with the app. They say you can learn a language in just ten minutes a day (for twenty years maybe), that isn't what I hate about it. It has many errors in the language hints and doesn't explain why you may have gotten an answer to a lesson wrong. I also dislike the competitive environment. I would not subscribe to it!"
"It's mostly a good app. I knocked off a point for the times where they are too fixed on a specific answer without accounting for other words that can be used in Spanish. I know the language, but don't know what specific wording they want typed out. Other times, they won't accept a direct translation from the English grammar they use in the question. Both Spanish and English make use of a gerund, i.e. ""eating"" is ""comiendo"" in Spanish."
"seems to no learn as fast as I was hoping to, especially in hearing. maybe it's just me. The ads sometimes take me to unsafe apps according to my Norton. Also, why don't you have ads in the language I'm studying. Af/er two years, I can have a basic conversation. But your Ads! One long minute of boring ad that is loud. Gime me a break!"
"This app makes me weirdly anxious. Ad revenue is obviously understandable to fund free education, but for a serious learner it is too restrictive unless you get a paid subscription. As lessons get more complex, each phrase holds more potential for several mistakes that feel traumatically like life or d‚Ç¨ath. You have to quit your progress and break that momentum by having to stop and regain hearts. It is putting me off of wanting to invest the time and focus if it is just going to be go-stop."
"This is a very magnificent app for building health habits of daily learning, with focus on languages! The choices of languages to learn is good for now, even though they still have to include so many other local languages and popular dialects of languages! One of the few improvements I want to find there is the interaction with community, which will help in language immersion for learners, and this way they can grow in their learning! This way the material will diverse and more interesting!"
"I still use it, but I don't suggest it for new users. It's all about competition, and the free version is basically useless. They like to upgrade graphics, but the learning experience has only gotten worse. You're either not learning because you only care about points or you're not learning because you're limited to five mistakes per day. You can pay to get out from under the five mistake limit, but then it's all about competing. This is a classic case of an app that lost its way after growing."
"I loved this app until the most recent update. Specifically the voice changes between a male & female for different words in the same sentence. After getting to a 640 day streak, I can't stand it & will not renew my premium subscription. As someone with learning & processing challenges, this just makes it stressful instead of fun."
"I love how fun this app makes learning interesting I love all the reminders and everything, but the language that I'm learning is something that I have picked a few words in and I can connect simple sentences. what we're learning is okay but I feel like it's informal, there are grammatical errors that needs to be fixed I'm learning Zulu and the Zulu that is spoken on the ground is somewhat different"
This is very helpful and good.I will suggest it to the children for learning languages because children love to play games so they can learn languages by playing it. But for teenageers and adults it would take much time to learn languages. But if you want to learn by this app that's your wish. You can learn from it üòÄ I'm also a teenageer I'm leaning language from this app. So I think this is a good app. Thanks üòä.
"simple mistakes, even repeated ones, count as much as important ones. I am dyslexic. I often confuse e-i, and some other spelling errors because I don't see them!! correctly. Duo sees them as intentional mistakes. Otherwise, it's a great way to begin to learn a language"
"It's been a month since I am using this app ... Everything about this app is good. I am not on Super Subscription yet I am able to get lost hearts by practising what else could be the best alternative I can't think of to practise,gain points in leaderboard and hearts at the same time. I express my thankfulness to the creator of this extraordinary application which can't be matched with any other language learning app on Play Store.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Doulingo needs more useful information. There's barely any normal sentences that I could use in a conversation. They normally put the weirdest sentences for you to type out or to say. This app doesn't even teach you how to count 1-10, or give you the option to try to learn the pronunciation of the words depending on what language you're learning. I wouldn't really recommend this app for learning a language. üòï"
"It's very good for a free app, and the advertising is tolerable etc. The encouragement from the owl is fun, they've clearly put some effort into this. I've been learning Japanese and it's mostly good, but is a bit limited in real life applications. Also I've been doing it for over 600 days and it still hasn't covered counting properly? It's only sporadically sort of briefly done numbers to tell time or ask if that doctor is 3 years old... üòÖ"
"I like doing maths on Duolingo as I struggle with maths a lot and Duolingo helps me but I think it is very unfair as I have to use a completely different phone to do it on. So I think that you should have the same features on android. I also think that you should maybe add extra hearts, not everyone has enough money for super Duolingo and to learn properly you have to make mistakes. The practice option could be improved if by practicing when you lose hearts you can gain more than five."
"This app has become increasingly more money hungry, as it hides features behind pay walls and ups the amount of adds to the point where I have to close and reopen the app after every lesson if I don't want an ad. The problem is, when I close and reopen the app, it doesn't save my streak or say I earned any exp. So even when I have done 10+ lessons in the past few days, the leader board says I only earned 28 exp. It also hasn't said I did any lessons in the past 2 days."
"generally very good though it moves pretty rapidly and the revision options aren't great, so progress feels rapid but retention is poor. having to be creative in ways of going back over stuff, but I use it as an accompaniment to structured taught lessons - and it's generally pretty fun too."
"This is a great app that helps you learn languages effectively! I love that I am determined to keep my streak going and that means I do my learning every day. It is designed to help you keep your streak going so it gives you ""freezes"" to use so you can skip a day every now and then without losing your streak. I love this app. I am at a 23 day streak with French and counting."
"Good for learning to read and listen. Not so good for conversation. Annoying that translations to perfectly acceptable UK or Australian English are marked as a mistake because US English is different. E.g. We say ""We celebrate New Year"" but it is marked incorrect because US says ""We celebrate New Year's.""!!! And this is an app that says it has AI! Perhaps it should have English English and Australian English as alternative languages to American English."
"I love this app, but I don't love how they reorganize lessons when you are mid unit. It may add more to the program, and I'm all about improvement, but it really makes it difficult when previous units that you ""completed"" now have vocabulary and concepts that you never learned and you have to try and double back to learn them."
"It's a good app for non-paying subscribers. There are some features available only to paying subscribers. However, I think it is still worth your time. One con that might annoy you if you're a native English speaker (perhaps also if you're learning English as a foreign language, although I can't speak to that) is the number of comma splices the app includes in answers or questions. In my opinion, that's unacceptable and a bad example for language learners. (Former foreign language teacher here.)"
"I really enjoy the app. My son and I are both both learning French and the Duo Lingo keeps him motivated is awesome . Good repetition, introduces new words and phrases in an intuitive manner. I sometimes have an issue with hearing slight differences, ano or agno. Phonetic spelling on request would be a suggestion Thanks for a very solid app"
Duolingo updated the course yet again and shuffled around all my progress but yet again they failed to teach me these words and phrasesthat apparently I'm supposed to know. So now there are even more questions that I don't understand but are popping up in the leader board challenges and other exercises. Extremely demotivating and annoying. I'm reconsidering my Super subscription.
"I really love learning languages with Duo. There is much variety so that it doesn't get boring. The only reason that I didn't put 5 stars is because I would like there to be an option to choose, for example, European Spanish or Mexican Spanish. In the end it seems to teach both because I have seen multiple words for some things, but as I travel to Mexico often for work, it would be nice to tailor the learning in that way. All that being said, I can't think of an easier, more fun way to learn"
"this app is great, and it very much helps with learning languages. however, it has an excessive amount of ads, with an ad shown every 2-3 lessons. it doesn't sound that bad, but lessons take 3 minutes tops, and i usually complete them in 1:30. that's an ad every 4 minutes and a half. insanity."
"It isn't truely motivating to keep learning your language day after day. It gets boring after a while. And I find that it doesn't actually help too much when trying to learn a language, I think that their methods aren't the best or just doesn't work well. It is good for a free app, and I doubt that premium would make the experience that much better. It is good that aren't ads every single lesson and that you can learn offline. Meh, it barely works. Y'know, if you are desperate. It is fine......"
The app is getting worse and worse. The score still doesn't always update. My progress isn't always stored - I've done some lessons 3 times! DUOLINGO DON'T RESPOND TO FEEDBACK! I paid for the app for a year. I don't think I'll be paying again! The only English is American English so in some cases I have to translate from French to US English to UK English! Seems like they care more about money than valuing language.
"It is AWESOME the perfect app to learn any language. It's safe, easy, and fun üòä. The new setup is great. Before it was so much now you can see that you don't have too much. I was always worried that I wouldn't understand someone who spoke fluent Spanish because I am learning but they added a lesson where it was just talking as if it were a real person. This shows me I would be able to understand. Doulingo is a confidence builder and a fun learning game. If I could rate it higher I would. ü•≥üòçüíØ"
"Successive updates have made this app more, rather than less, unstable on my Nokia. It is failing more often than not to apply the double points, and there are issues with the word bank disappearing. Quite often the story doesn't open quickly or at all in level 7."
"I have tried many language apps and programs and Duolingo has impressed me. I know over 5 languages already and I feel it has never been as easy and affordable to learn a new one. The app is very user friendly, and it tailors exercises in a way that is fun to do. You also feel part of a community of learners, which makes learning motivating even if you are by yourself. I love the product design and investing on the monthly fee is also well worth it when compared when other options out there"
"Actually it's a nice app, but the french course isn't as good as it should be. For context I am learning french my 6th year, currently having B2, so I use Duolingo to revise and learn new vocabulary. First of all the course offers few possibilities of answers. I can't pass certain levels, because only one answer is correct even though there are 3 different ways of answering in real life. The second thing is, I noticed some vocabulary being outdated/less in use than the not-accepted synonym."
"The app is is good BUT there are two reasons I take out 3 stars: The voice recognition has issues to understand very short phrases, in my case, when it ask a sequence of 3 numbers in german, or the word Euro. AND, during timed events, when the clock expires there is a pop-up message that will offer you to buy extra time using gems, the buy button is where the Next Question button is, it swaps, it makes it look scummy, like if the devs want you to click on it by mistake, and the purchase is final"
"This app is really great, but currently, I'm having some difficulty to progress as the app may bug When I finish a level, the progress is not immediately displayed and sometimes we have to pass the level again and again to see the progress. Please solve this issue. Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Better than lessons. Fun for kids and adults! Still no issues after using it for a while. I want to get the paid for version when I have more time and money! However, recently tried a trial for paid version and I can't play offline! Plus, I can't find out how to cancel it."
"very good app to learn a new language. im learning quick and efficiently. you get daily reminders to do lessons. the lessons go from typing in the language, speaking, hearing and matching etc. you can also have a friends list to compare with your friends or contact you know. very good feedback. keep up the great work Duolingo, and all the best with the languages. Ich lieben Duolingo!"
"I've been using this app since July 2021. I really loved it's experience and the way they teach you through very basic to intermediate level. The user interface makes it very easy for a totally new person to understand. I would have given a more star if it has a bit more than intermediate knowledge, but for a beginner it's just awesome...!!!"
"I like this app for learning Italian. However it doesn't seem to detect my microphone for speaking exercises which is on and for which I have given permission to be used. This has not been a problem using Duolingo in the past so idk why it is now, and I've always had an Android. Please fix. Also grammar lessons in between would be helpful to understand WHY it's like this."
"Duo is a good tool to learn a language. I've improved my sentence structures. The problem is that not enough grammar is taught or given in the hints to help with the lesson ahead. Why has the discussion button been removed, which was very helpful when I wasn't understanding the sentences & other uses explained why I was getting it wrong, invaluable. All duo does is mark the sentence in red with no explanation. Can't get gems anymore either, you use to watch an ad for them, disappointing üòï"
"I really want the app to have more English learning material, e.g, grammar tips, pronunciation tips/rules e.g., for the letter 's' (in the middle or at the end of a word) as either 'z'-sound or 's'-sound. !Please pay attention on what I would most like you to add: The use of the International Phonetic Alphabet for the pronunciation of the sounds / words in every dialogue / text in the app will be absolutely useful for the learners. It will greatly help the correct pronunciation."
"Well, I mean, it's a great app, and I've learned so much Japanese on it! But, why does it send u Sooooooooooo many notifications? My phone is starting to glitch because of it and every time I set my phone to not disturb me at night, It still dings! And the button on my phone to turn the notifications on apps of isn't working properly, so plz fix this!"
"I never review products so this is a first. duo has helped me learn and use German to communicate somewhat well. although there are some things that I wish duo would teach within the first unit. it is a solid experience that I have suggested to others who want to learn languages. Good app, I wish there was a dictionary for researching and studying words for future reference."
"Great way to learn a new language. I have stayed motivated, and stayed with this app for two years and learned French up to a useful daily level. They have gamified it to creat fun incentives to keep learning and practicing every day. Need a few more options to practice writing/translating."
"one of the few apps I would not mind paying a subscription for , I traded in scrolling endlessly on different social media apps to learning a new language . Personally it fits my learning style to a T and is super easy to understand. I would recommend to others wanting to learn a new language or just explore something new and different."
"I have been on here for years. I've both paid and done the free stuff. I don't feel like it's challenging enough, Duo repeats a lot of the same material which is great for memorization but I do not feel challenged. Merely static."
"I'm currently learning Italian with a 79-day streak. Duolingo is a perfect app for learning a language. However, the notifications do tend to get annoying but it does get me to do a lesson. It's funner when you do it with your friends because it'll give you quests and you and your friend can complete them to get extra gems and you can give your friend gifts too."
You can't find pricing for Duolingo anywhere in the app or on the website FAQ. Then they bill you annually instead of monthly. This is absolutely deceptive. Be transparent. 04/2024 - this app is still terribly predatory in its pricing. They repeatedly try to trick you into signing up with a free trial and then bill you for a year. GFSF'ed Duolingo.
"I'm back after several years away and I've gotta say, the improvements they've made are exactly what I wanted when I stopped using the app. I use it for Japanese and they now include explanations for grammar and guides for how to write the characters. things I had to try to work out for myself the first time. highly recommend!"
"The sound options are minimal, almost non-existent. I use headphones because I don't want to disturb people around me when I do my lessons, but I can't stop the vibrations when I go up in my rank or when I solve a difficult question. Even when I disable the sound effects, the vibrations are still there. Please give the users more options regarding the vibrations! Edit: Did you REALLY have to make the Lightning Rounds more expensive? 30 gems was enough already! Why is it 100 gems now? WHY?!?"
The app sucks now. They let go of 700 employees in favor of AI and it shows. Cancelled my membership (I was a paid member of Super Duolingo) after 3 full days of getting the same exercise in the practice section. Literally the exact same. Used to be great. Absolutely awful now to the point where all the people on my friends list have abandoned the app too... Really sad considering I had 200+ day streak before it went downhill.
I find it difficult to learn when the answers are often filled in for me. It mainly occurs when i am asked to translate. It was not happening in the intro. Only started happening in level 1. Also some of the question is covered over by the multiple choice answers if the question is longer than 1 line. Im reluctant to move forward as I am struggling to learn with this app. Please could you respond to this bug as I have reported it many times now. Also keeps freezing up!
"good bite-sized lessons, and they definitely hold you accountable! I personally enjoy the little applause for reaching a goal, and they make sure to congratulate you. I really would recommend this app! the only problem I could see is that it is made for more traveling purposes, so if you were looking to be fluent and to have a very wide range of vocabulary, then it might be limited for you. but still, all things aside, I do recommend!"
"I have been using it for a long time (with Duolingo Plus nearly 3 years), but now that I have the opportunity to use my knowledge seems like if I didn't knew anything, all the grammar explanation for small languages is almost forgotten in the app, the only thing that could change this point is a more detailed grammar explanation section, like the one that appears up top every path, besides this huge disadvantage the whole app is good for learning languages."
"Usually after a while of learning a language I get bored and don't want to anymore, but with Duolingo I always want to study a language. I've been using it for about 4 months and it's perfect. Recommended for All ages. But what I also recommend is learning langauges one at a time, because at some point you stop learning the other language and foeget it. Love Duolingo!"
"This app is amazing! There is not very many adds and I can learn offline. I can have many courses and I actually enjoy learning. I was a little frustrated about the hearts but not to much. It is really fun and helped me learn a lot. I am learning Japanese, French, and a few others and honestly have never gotten so far in Japanese. I have never seen an app as good as this and haven't had any major issues. I am having significant progress and feel confident so I really suggest this for learning."
"The app asked me to review them... So here it is. The lessons work and you do learn the language, but you'll want to blow your brains out because of the constant ads to buy ""Super Duolingo"". Then you have the stupid heart system they use that basically screws you from learning anymore because you're just too frustrated to continue with the lesson. I have no clue who's idea it was to force this Super Duolingo down your throat for more then the cost of Netflix, but it's not working."
"His app can be good to help you practise a language. Don't think that this would teach you the language, it will not. You need a Basic knowledge to benifit from using it. Not all languages are equal, I find French good, but German is really poor, there is no help or guidance. It appears as though the French language course has been created by a team that have America English in their 2nd language, the English is frequently quite odd / poor."
"Great app for learning languages with just a couple of exceptions: I'm learning Spanish, and unfortunately, Duolingo fails to explain some rules or exception to rules. For example: clase is feminine, but restaurante is masculine. The only way you'll learn this is by failing it in a test question... and if it was the question that causes you to fail the test, too bad. Due to not being taught by a human, I've reached a learning block and Duo doesn't recognize it."
"Great app to pair with other language learning resources or for beginners. Gets regular updates but can be lacking in features for some languages. Worth getting premium when it's discounted, particularly for those who want to speed through lessons and review later. Currently having issues with the app not giving me different vocabulary to review in the words tab, only the same set over and over."
"It doesn't recognize me correctly pronouncing a phrase even when I know I'm saying it correctly. Also, I guess because some of it is AI, the words sound identical (French). They need to make pural and single words more clear. It's fun otherwise. I'm not sure how much I'm really learning but I'm going to keep with it"
"I've been learning Japanese, and so far it's been a really fun experience. Even if you're really busy it's usually pretty easy to find time even for just one lesson because they're so short, and the way you gradually build up knowledge of terms and grammar seems to me to be pretty well designed, plus the leaderboards and rewards add a little extra motivation and make it really fun. Definitely recommend"
"It absolutely infuriates me that I lose my streak in less than 24 hours because the clock changes to a new calendar day. Seriously, I lost a streak in 8 hours or less. the streaks are nice and, in a way, they keep you going, however, Duolingo doesn't seem to understand the concept of what a day means. This wouldn't be so bad but duolingo doesn't really teach you. They tell you what to say but, not why it's said the way it is. I don't know any of the grammatical rules. Not a good way to learn."
"Just hit my 2000 day streak, and now I'm leaving. Wanted to go out on a nice number, but I've been meaning to leave for some time. There's just no more learning here. You get penalized for mistakes while being told is ok to make mistakes, that replaced the human voice with AI so I can't trust the pronunciation (and that's my weak point with learning Irish). It feels more focused on getting engagement than learning these days. I hit 2000, now I'm free to go find some place to actually learn"
"I really didn't like the New update First of all the Logo has been changed and instead of making me feel energetic and enthusiastic it really makes me feel dull, feeble, lazy and frustrated Second the courses have been totally changed especially the Mandarin one as before new update they used to start with greetings at first for the rookie but now they teach stuffs like coffee,tea etc. Kindly, fix the issues ASAP"
"It was great, i wouldve gave a 5 star review but they updated the course on a language, which added characters that are completely out of my level, and it was extremely confusing and i dont want to restart my progress. I wish there was an option to choose if I wanted the new course or not."
"Duolingo is a great app for learning a language and has great potential, but it gets a bit repetitive after a while, and most children these days don't have a long attention spam so they'd get bored quick while hence making learning much harder or even none at all suggestions I have 1. You can learn similar words first if possible and/or letters in the alphabet (if it is in another writing system) 2. Save streaks during famous holidays, cause it's harder to learn whole with your family on Xmas."
"If you care about the game experience (and I'm guessing you do or you wouldn't have picked this app), don't use Android. I've been steadily struggling to keep up in leagues with the same level of effort. From several weeks of top 3 diamond down to Obsidian and dropped again. Then someone pointed out you get less xp on each lesson on Android than iOS. I double checked on my iPad, I can get 20-30xp/lesson there with no bonus active. Same lesson, same time on my Android phone gets me 10xp."
"For practice exercises to be custom to the users, unit reviews and target practice should always be available. I am often doing my studies without sound on to avoid disturbing others. So when the featured practice is perfect pronunciation or listen up, all I can do is mistake review until that runs out. I use the practice exercises to hammer my studies home and I am very disappointed that the exercises I need are not always available."
"It's ok, but it seems to rely on participation awards and shaming, which was pretty off-putting for me. I'd prefer it was more positive without being patronizing. It seems intent on pointing out mistakes and weaknesses, which often aren't weaknesses in reality (how do they come up with them?) And sometimes the mistakes are a clumsy thumb. I wish I liked it more."
this app is really good for learning the basics of a new language. but the narration is very annoying. it's impossible to listen to music while using the app. every time i start on a new question the narration will also decrease the volume of my music. they should have at least a function to disable the narration
"This app is greatfull! It helps us to know new words and sometimes conversation, listening section and even speaking section. But i cant give it 5 stars cuz a few days ago the speaking section doesnt work well. And i lost my heart :). I've reported many times and trying to fix it in setting. But it hasnt changed yet."
"You are amazinggg. Yeah. Eres asombrosoo!!!! Your concept of the streak have kept me hooked to this app. Its helping me use my time so much better. Im having so much fun and learning alott a the same time. And the rewards you give after each lesson are just amazing. The coding, the game like structure and the notifications, the casualness and user friendliness of duolingo is just amazing. It has changed my life."
"Duolingo has massively helped me to start learning italian by doing little bits every day. Obviously you cant expect to be fluent off of repeating a few sentences a day on an app but it helps me to grasp the meaning of words and formulate sentences which has much enhanced my learning, and I will say that I would have been a useless tourist on my recent italy trip without it. Thank you to the brilliant minds behind a simple tool to help you learn without much fuss :)"
"I absolutely love this app for my German studies! I bought super Duolingo and it's been very helpful and fun! Although, me and my roommate are both studying German and we agree it would be very helpful if Match Madness included der/das/die in the matches. We both struggle with memorizing the articles and it would be a cool feature to add in. Thanks for an awesome app!"
"Not too bad, but there are e few annoying things. For example the constant urges to buy yourself time, or streak freezes or whatever. Plus, I wanted to make my profile private, but nobody bothered to answer my requests about how to do that. Anyway, in general, not too bad and in any case better than doing nothing, I guess."
"The best app for learning languages in a playful and easy way. A few improvements are needed, though. The leaderboard doesn't update quickly. Also I don't get the rewards sometimes due to technical glitches."
"Love the app but nobody replies to emails, customer service is absolutely appalling which is disappointing especially when you are paying for the super subscription. I want to be able to add my son so he can enjoy it too. Unfortunately I think once my subscription is up, I will try one of the other language apps!"
"There's not enough examples in the exercises, the same sentences are repeating too often. There's hardly any flexibility allowed in answers. An answer may be correct, but it is considered false, because the author of the question didn't bother to put alternatives into possible input options. Narrow-minded and lazy!"
"If you think you can seriously learn a language with this app better look further. I use it as a supplement to an irl course or I would long abandon it. Gamification works to a certain extent, but at the amount of effort this program requires to be useful you would be better off with a textbook. It's simultaneously too much repetitiveness and not enough practice, my settings for Japanese keep glitching and turning on romaji. Plus abundance of artificial audio instead of real native speakers."
"It's too good for learning new languages. People , who want to go for holidays in a foreign country they can easily learn the languages in a short period of time. The most cutest character in this app is duo , He will help you in any problem. So, for learning new languages I would prefer Duolingo app . It is not helpful for me but also for many people."
"Duolingo: Fun, Accessible, But Room to Grow Duolingo's bite-sized lessons and gamification kept me engaged in learning (language). The vast language selection is amazing, and its free version opens doors for all. I especially appreciate the focus on practical skills and the supportive community. However, more speaking/listening practice and expansion into complex grammar for advanced learners would be fantastic. Integrating with other platforms could create a more well-rounded experience."
"Really good except I'm encountering an issue which doesn't allow me to progress to the next lesson without restarting the app, and it's really bothering me having to restart every lesson. Every time I finish, it just prompts the same level again and I'm not sure why, it didn't always do this but now it's every time."
"Reiterating, because this keeps happening. Wow. Don't pay for gems. Just did the match challenge, and EVERY word in the first set was a word I hadn't yet learned, and the words take too long to come back when you make a match. Then, more words I've not yet learned. Thus, strategically causing a loss to your gems, and if you paid, then you lost money as well. Stop doing these kinds of things, Duo! Good grief, why do I even have to say that?"
"Very good app! I would give it five stars if there was a way we could select a specific unit to practice, and also if it had a way of teaching conjugation rules. I'm learning Finnish, and I'm still confused with conjugating verbs and such. It would also be 5 stars if it wasn't giving me words I haven't learned at all. In my Italian course, I've had to match the English with the Italian word. It gave me plate, hat, and another word I didn't know. Please fix this Duo! üôè"
"The best app in the world! I love Duo and it's ""lingo"" aspect and here's why. A good thing about it is that you can learn any language you want for free. Another fantastic feature is game-like learning and the strike. They really give me huge sense of achievement. The only problem are, of course, hearts. It's shame that you can do so little in free version daily. All in all, I would recommend the app to literally everyone. Even people not interested in languages can learn one here quite well! 5!"
As im using this app more and more I keep finding some features being annoying for example when I'm typing an answer on my keyboard on timed lessons sometimes the prompt for buying a timer boost pops up closing my keyboard and me miss-clicking to buy boosts even though I did not want to.. There also could be some explanations to why a word changes in a sentence now its just learning words. BUT over all its a great app to get started with most of the languages
my daughter got me into this. I was leaning Spanish for years and started to give up. but this app is bringing it all back but best off all teaching me words I have never seen. so beautifully diverse avatars and just an all round comfortable interface. just brilliant. it has adds but it's free so ads are no proble for such a life skill like learning a new language. this is so much fun üòä
"It's okay, but for some reason, it keeps taking away the xp points that I have, and it doesn't get any when I do new lessons. I've done multiple lessons and I'm still in the demotion zone at 40 xp. This is just really annoying. (Edit: ... Okay, so it started working right after I left the review so I guess I'll add like three more stars to the rating.)"
"A really great app for language learning! I do wish there was some customization with the monthly quests, mine keeps becoming a larger and larger amount and it's a bit overwhelming. I'd like to have some control on that."
"Hey guys, I think this app is great and also with some weird stuff, but the case is that I've already ended my course yesterday and it doesn't looks like it has an end, should I play and compete in this game eternally? I don't think so, it's a little bit unpractical, beside it took me 5gb of storage to do it, I don't have storage enough to play to the end of times; it could be better, like all normal game that come to an real end, however nice if you need to learn and don't have another option."
"I like using Duolingo, but there seem to be some small flaws in how some words are spoken. There is a report it feature but it's only a chose one and then move on, you can't explain what the problem is. All in all, this is a very good app and I would recommend it for people who want to learn a new language."
"Definitely 4 stars! I'm having a few problems. 1) I started Japanese while learning German and it worked for a day but then deleted my Japanese course. 2) something is up with my streak. It told me my streak was at 83 on the widget, 82 in the app, and 81 in the notifications. 3) there is something odd with the hearts, it keeps saying I have 1 and then I mess something up and makese quit but then still says I have 1 left. Thank you for your time"
honestly it's much more fun learning languages using duo lingo than learning it in school. the weekly competitions gives everyone a chance to win and having monthly challenges is fun. the app might not tech you how to speak fluently but it helps you understand the structure of the Languages you learn.
"Best free app for learning vocabulary. Finish first section to ublock story section with dialogues. I learn Spanish, Italian, French and Russian and this is great for learning new words and basic grammar. Minus for putting a lot of similar question but with different gender/plural/the un which is really frustrating. Ask same question instead of similar ones with added one letter l"
Lately the review section in the paid version has greatly decreased in quality. The same training session repeats over and over again until the next day. The good thing about the the paid version is that you could conveniently train all passed levels in one place. Now it's just one level and the same phrases over and over again.
"When I first started Duolingo I didn't know anything about German and that was going to be my new language this year in school and guess what... Duolingo helped me so much that now I am the best in my class. It is also so fun to create a streak and see where you are on the ladder. I would definitely recommend Duolingo, it is the best app to learn new languages. Thanks to the Duolingo team for creating this amazing app. We are loving it‚ô•Ô∏è"
We've been paid members for a couple years now and we LOVE Duolingo!! Each of us has learned way more using Duolingo than we ever did in school learning the same languages. One of the coolest things to me is that I've been able to also learn just some basics in several different languages to kind of get a feel for them. Their methods work and actually make learning a language fun. The option to be competitive is also a big plus. Excellent!!
Duolingo is a game changer when it comes to learning a new language. I struggled with learning Spanish back in highschool but this clicks with me. I think the difference is that it's like playing a game with levels and challenges and a social media aspect to it. so it doesn't feel like memorizing phrases and words but more of a game that just happens to teach you another language
"UPDATE: Still no response from the developer. App still not working - strongly suggest you don't use this app. App randomly froze and wouldn't let me in. Tried deleting/reinstalling it, got asked to sign in and it's saying there's an error. If I reset my password it says there's no account registered with my email despite still getting emails telling me to keep up the good work. Have lost my streak and the effort I put in - emailed the support team but heard nothing. Terrible service"
"This app is great for getting some vocabulary, and you kind of can figure some grammar from trial and error. But the daily refresh section has gone down to hell in recent months, with the app recommending to ""practice your weak words"" over and over again for months on end. I don't know if the issue is the same in the paid version."
"You can actually learn a lot from this app even if you're just a toddler cuz its really fun with the animations and different games/ways of learning. The lives are good even without infinite hearts to challenge those who can't and don't wanna buy the premium! I also like how it doesn't pressure you that much even if you choose everyday learning, and just reminds you to take a lesson in one day and not exactly 24 hours or you'll lose the streak. Overall gg, and educational for all ages."
"Terrible, I get y'all need to make money, but the heart system that is in place makes it almost impossible to learn a language at a pace you would like, and punishes you on new lessons and material you don't know yet, as well as taking 4 hours PER HEART to get back, one of the WORST language learning platforms out there, used to be good Edit: multiple years later, if I could give it even lower I would, app still trying it's hardest to make it impossible for you to actually learn the language"
"The app is well polished and fun. However, more content should be added to existing courses. Italian only has A1 level, which allows for a very limited understanding of the language but that's it. Also, I would like to see the type and scale of the friend's quest configurable by the user and rewards given accordingly."
"1)You give the double experience and then take it, and it doesn't count. It happens too often! 2) I often push ""can't speak/hear"" button by mistake! And I can't cancel it! Add the ""cancel"" button to overturn the changes! 3)The feedback on pronunciation would be great with the wrong sounds outlined"
Great app to start with but as i move further up the levels there is lot of written questions what isnt very helpful for learning if you have dyslexia like myself its put. Me off the app and learning i would like to see more spoken and put the letter in the correct place exercises. Or maybe put an accessible option on the app.
"Duo is more of a resource, it's helpful to learn a language if you know the basics or have another source to learn from. On a negative note the app will give you a limited window to earn double points which will make the leader board challenging because it's on their time not when I'm able to. (Not everyone keeps the same schedule)"
"I absolutely love it and would give it a five star rating except for one thing. It keeps saying I'm offline, even when I'm not. My network would be fine, with very other app would be working, but Duolingo would say I'm offline and I'd lose access to my lessons. I've ruined my streak because of this problem. I dunno how to fix it"
"For the most part, it's a wonderful app. I have had some issues with typing in words in the Navajo language that should have been accepted but weren't, mainly when I have to type an 'o' with an ogonek accent. I generally have to copy and paste it when needed since I can't type it using the English Samsung keyboard. Also, there are no listening exercises after the first few lessons which makes it difficult to learn pronunciation. I am learning Navajo so this may not apply to other languages."
"Decided to come back to learning Japanese on this app after taking a pretty long break from it, and this ¬´coming back¬ª experience was very frustrating and confusing: the app greeted me with ¬´welcome back¬ª, but offered no help with getting back on track. I tried starting from the very first lesson that was accessible to me, but I couldn't ¬´retake¬ª that lesson, only ¬´review¬ª, so, having forgotten a hefty part of what I've previously learned, I kept making mistakes and quickly ran out of ¬´hearts¬ª."
"It crashes very often. For example, I cannot start an app, or sometimes a lesson. Or what's even more frustrating, when I finish a lesson, it gets stuck on loading and I have to start all over again. Do something with this. And by the way, I'm learning Spanish and why on earth would you remove from course such an important form as ""vosotros"" which us CONSTANTLY used in Spain??"
"When you get something wrong, they don't offer an explanation why it was wrong or explain the grammar behind it. They're basically like, no. Try again. I don't like that there's no lessons, they just throw new stuff at you repeatedly and figure it'll eventually stick. This method takes so much longer than if we actually understood how the language works."
It would be better if the introduction of new word meanings wasn't done in a multiple choice style question. I don't know the language and I'm only being given a 25% chance to get it right. Statistically im only going to be able to learn 6 words before i used up my daily fails. Even with another romantic language in my arsenal there are differences that you have to just guess at. I've lost motivation to participate in an app that punishes you for not knowing something you're trying to learn.
This app makes it simple to stay familiar with a language previously learned. It's free to use with ads and has many ways to familiarize yourself with the language including writing out characters and reading/listening to phrases and filling them in. So much love for this app! A great way to pass time!
"Quite good, but it will sometimes say that trousers is a incorrect translation, because you didn't put pants. Also, if you make a mistake, it won't always tell you why you're incorrect, just what the correct answer is, and sometimes you need an explanation. For example, if it was to do with the order of words. Also, the 5 hearts thing is very annoying, and you have to pay to have unlimited hearts. But, it has helped me to learn French, and is quite effective, if you can get around these problems"
"The lessons are made exciting and very informative; all in a stress-free and relaxed atmosphere in order to aid even the most beginner type Learner in understanding, hearing, matching, and speaking the language with fun and ease. I especially love the characters' emojis as a means to both complement and encourage the Learner every time they score a correct point on each lesson exercise. Definitely helps the Learner to stay motivated with every passing progress."
"While I can appreciate the effectiveness of game-type elements for keeping people regularly engaging with language learning, there are some aspects of how they actually teach a language that are sub-par. Main examples that come to mind are a lack of explanation of grammatical concepts or language nuances in general, and especially the lack of articles when drilling vocab in gendered languages. Also, their corrections of mistakes with ambiguous translations are often misleading."
"Absolutely WORTH IT!!!! Holy Molly ahhah.. I can't recommend this apl enough. It's a really fun way to learn a language. In the beginning I thought this is not going to help me at all! I am going to forget everything I am learning. But OMG!!! This app is unconscious learning!! Like kids, Absolutely AMAZING AND FRIENDLY INTERFACE ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
I love the app but it keeps glitching and the widget tells me I've done my lesson for the day at like 10pm (i live on a very atypical sleep schedule) and then i go to do the next days lesson at like 3am and it says I've used a streak freeze. Has happened at least 10 times. Really frustrating. I mean I do lessons regularly enough that I'm not without a streak freeze for long but still annoying that the widget glitching is messing up my streak because I depend on it to tell me if I'm okay!
"duolingo is wonderful for learning a new language but there is the problem of the paid subscription. I believe if an app is a learning app they should pay a life fee and have it forever instead of like ¬£60 a year I think. also the heart system they use is ok as unlike other apps you don't just wait an hour and regenerate hearts, you earn them by practicing"
"I'm learning Italian, and as someone who has learned Italian before, the very first introductory unit is horrifying. I've gotten exercises where I've had to repeat names - what exactly am I learning in those? I've also gotten exercises where I've had to repeat ""Ah"" - why? What's the point? The lessons are horribly put together and if you really, truly want to learn another language to a point where you can speak it, understand it and understand how it works, there are much better ways than this."
"It was good app, but now it has an issue with the sound: when the sound of a word or a phrase is supposed to play, it usually doesn't. Listening-exercises are useless now, impossible to complete. The support team doesn't respond."
Duolingo is the best free language learning app! Thanks to the developers. But one challenge you will experience is the limited hearts ‚ù§ you can earn when you don't susbcribe monthly fee. This disrupts the lessons because if you make five mistakes you have to go back to the practice part to earn hearts. Again the maximum number of hearts you can take is just 5. This means you cannot plan the sesisons due to this limited hearts. Please increase number of hearts to 20 or more. Thanks
This is by far the best learning app for learning a different language. It helps me in all the ways that I need to learn. I would always start with other apps but this one keeps me reminded with the streaks. I really enjoy this app because it's also very fun while learning. I lastly also love that Duolingo is helping kids and adults all around the world üåé‚ù§Ô∏è
"generally I like the app and it helps me motivate to learn despite busy life.yet I find some part of interface unintuively placed but most of all I'm missing the lessons - regular readings and explanations, beside learning by choosing. it's also better for total beginners and quite boring and discouraging if you already know some language and whant to skill up. podcast app is only for iPhone! and nag screens about the app are diaplayed on Android - what is it? free apple add?"
"Makes learning fun and easy, but I wish they would explain grammatical rules instead of leaving you to figure it out through trial and error. I would also enjoy using a vocabulary practice feature. Also, they insist upon using homosexual references and situations, which isn't typically enjoyable for people who don't subscribe to those beliefs, and shouldn't be included if children also use this app."
It's good and amazing like you are learning a language by an app which seems to be a game but the only problem I am facing is the limited hearts like I am not a teenager or an adult who could take a subscription on their own and my parents would never allow me to do so and also their are ads like after every lesson. So I would recommend the old version not the new version.
"App itself, technically speaking, is perfect, everything is well thought of. However, content which is the most important thing leaves a lot to be desired... For example, Korean class is not very good. Legendary level covers new words and phrases which are not included in regular practice. Regular practice is just repetition without many new sentences. Fine, if that's the concept, but what about the new words? Also, too many different sentences in just one go. I cannot memorize all of that."
"It is fun, it keeps moving, but at a pace you set for yourself. Learning German for me, will take time. But I find this app is just right as it's enjoyable and you make it what you want by challenging yourself to the next steps. I look forward to each day, either for new challenges, or simply going over what I have learned. I like the cartoon figures and after a while you learn how to utilize more things within the Dulingo App. I am actually surprised by the diversity and how it works."
"The app works on Montessori learning , so it is very fun and playful . But , as everything has , it has a tiny problem üòê . I entered the amethyst league, which is far, so I decided to stop. I disabled the leagues, and after a couple of days , I GOT a NOTIFICATION THAT I WAS DEMOTED TO THE EMERALD LEAGUE . And also I love daily my animations. Pls üôè fix these. It is really annoying, but in rest , the app enters in 5üåü categories. Upgrade the appüéñüîù!!!"
"It's really good for learning languages, I'm learning gaelic but considering the spelling is always not what it seems and there's a lot less gaelic letters than English it's kinda confusing when they throw in random names, as well as the fact the audio is very low quality and seems poorly recorded when listening to words for putting a sentence together. Aside from that really bugging me, I enjoy the app."
"I like the learning style overall. A lot of fluffy ""fun"" things of you're into that. But not an oppressing amount. Please add an option to remove ads for a one time fee. I don't need all the extra stuff for subscribing, I just don't want the forced ads..."
"I think that sometimes the app isn't clear about the prizes when you complet the lessons. Also, I saw that sometimes I wrote the answer or the sentences in the correct way and the app don't accept my text. However, I enjoy learning new vocabulary and differents ways when I want to say something. That's funny and very important for me."
The way the app has been designed to feel like it's a game is entirely the reason why I am able to come back each day and achieve the daily goals... Also the characters and personalities they have created are entertaining and enjoyableüòä and it is much easier to progress and learn when you have friends involved to keep each other motivated!
"I did give this App a 5* review. I had a family subscription so had paid them for their premium package. Then I had to replace my phone. When I tried to access my account I realized, after days of trying, that I must have used a capital letter in my email address. Therefore, no way to access any emails they send if you have forgotten your password. You cannot auto change your username/email, like other memberships. Duolingo has very bad customer service & I've lost my money. BEWARE!"
"App has become increasingly worse at recognizing speech. Have to yell and still app doesn't recognize me. I don't know how the mechanics of app become worse after years and increased funding from ipo but the whole speech issue stops it from being a 5 star app. Also de nada in spanish translates into, ""it's nothing,"" not, ""you're welcome."" Teach me the literal language not the interpretation. And if you teach the interpretation then it should be along side the literal meaning."
"It's a good app, but it really bums me out that there's no minority languages, like Slovak. I downloaded it mostly to help my friends learn english, but they can't because the Slovak language isn't there. And literally no other apps have it either. And I'm sure this is a big problem with many other small countries in the world with practically unknown languages."
"A very motivating app with many different kinds of experience. Duolingo trains speaking, hearing, writing and more. These different experiences help you learn the language faster. There are also many unique languages available but you need to learn some in English wich is not important to native speakers but to people who are learning English and another language."
It's fine to get a basic on pronunciation but if you're going to try learning a language with a very different grammar structure to English you're eventually going to stall out on here and have to find another source to learn. Throwing sentences at people with no context on why one works differently than another is not helpful at the end of the day.
"This is the best app ever! it's helping me with my learning and I ace my tests in school in Japanese! I hope other people download this app because it helps you learn certain languages. like Spanish, Japanese, French, Chinese, etc. it is a really good source if you are preparing for travel, just want to understand a friend, or for job improvement! I love Duolingo because it makes learning fun!"
My lessons don't get added to my streak unless I click through all the continue buttons to make it back to the home screen after the lesson. Previously you could access discussions on individual questions and someone will have explained the grammar on answers I didn't understand. Now I keep getting the same questiions wrong because I don't understand what rules apply. There were also better guides at the start of each level explaining the grammar.
"Easy to use and the gamification is good to keep you interested. However this app has a lot of adds which really slows down my learning and makes me feel like I'm actually wasting my time as a lot of time is spent watching adds and instead of learning. An add after every 1 minute lesson is far, far too much. There is another Spanish app called memrise which is not as ""gamey"" but is far better for actually learning Spanish."
"I got tricked by the UI design during a match challenge when the time ran out. Half the screen gets covered by a prompt, and if you were tapping to select the matches and it pops up, it is simply !ding! thanks for spending your gems. Add at least 1 second delay before selections can be made for match challenge boost purchase when time runs out. üíØ Absolutely inept design."
"pretty good at what it's supposed to do. however, it's buggy quite often, and the shop prices are outlandish. Also the update removed your ability to see your progress towards achievements and the longest streak , highest level achieved etc is off cuz how would I get the achievement if it says my highest level wrong ? There's better apps. You almost have to have pro"
"it's great honestly. I've been learning Korean and it's been helping me. It's not like they force you to watch ads every 5 seconds,most of the time you can choose whether you get an ad or not. And instead of having to wait for days for hearts,you can practice for them! it's a great learning game/app for any age if willing to learn more of a language!"
"I like recent changes to the platform and have updated my review in light of this. Still buggy in places, the speech input is inaccurate sometimes, and it would be nice if you could select learning a language in another language without changing the setting globally on the app. Also, each time on the path should give you an option to test forward. The next section is too far, and each time is so tedious that day learners will get bored reiterating same words. But otherwise, this app is improved."
"They have the worst English translations for accepted answers when you're learning Chinese, forcing you to answer like someone who has never learned English before, or you get it ""wrong"". Absolutely terrible to release a language course in two such dominant languages, in our day and age, with literal millions of people who could have checked it for them and fixed it before it was launched. Answers like ""He has 3 friends really? ‚Äù....."
"I would normally give it more but it's been having bugs and their help center is non existent. Just automated responses and websites that are not working. I've been trying to use ""speak"" lesson. Duo tells me to turn on mic (it's already on). I click ""turn on"" either way and nothing happens"
"Not being able to replace words in the middle of a sentence causing timeouts during timee challenges is unacceptable UX, especially when it leads to a popup to spend gems. ""Hey, want to spend money because of our bad UX?"" ------------------------------------------ Too many ""words"" being tested phonetically without providing the meaning. - App crashes when I start a lesson two minutes before midnight and finish at midnight causing a steak freeze to be lost"
"The one size fits all Duolingo experience is joyless. Just follow the path with no hope of anything new or any choice in your learning ever possible. After I grew to despise the leagues and leader boards, remove them and this is a very stark and non interactive singular path for every user. What you want to learn is not valued. Just click the next spot in the lesson. I think this is the worst way to structure a language learning app. Now I hear they laid off their workers to use AI instead. evil"
"Overall nice app but sometimes gives you practise without actually teaching you something previously. For example, the app doesn't give you a comprehensive explanation or a tutorial on case conjugations, and then you get a practise in which you have to use case conjugation. Then when you get it wrong you lose a life. E.g. Fill in the blank: –í ____ –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö (–∑–æ–æ–ø–∞—Ä–∫, –∑–æ–æ–ø–∞—Ä–∫–∞, –∑–æ–æ–ø–∞—Ä–∫–µ). Exactly how is a person trying to learn Russian supposed to know this without any tutoring? Guessing?"
it's an amazing app that makes me learn so many symbols and letters in many countries but I wish they could have added basics and how it sounds rather then learning a word really fast without even knowing the basic sound and alphabets of the language but I'm still very impressed and comfortable with the app its an app where you could improve better and I know a lot because of this!! just hope it takes my advicee
I love this little cute owl! ü¶âüü¢ So cute ü•∞ and encourages me to learn Spanish and more. Very immersive in learning languages and encourages you to keep going. The stories and context is funny and also important in learning the language. The badges and limited time achievements give you motivation to collect them all! Currently have a 191 day streak!
"I've been using Duolingo for years and have learned a good deal of Spanish. So, yes, I recommend this app. That being said, I am occasionally frustrated by the lack of explanations for some things that I don't understand. There is also a problem with being overly encouraged to do a lot of lessons in a day, to a point where it's becoming more about quantity of exercises than quality of learning. I think I'm starting to plateau in learning as a result."
"As an app Duolingo is fantastic *IF* you can access it. As a paid subscriber, I have no customer service support after getting logged out of the app. There is no phone number. Support emails go unanswered. Automated emails provide broken links that do not load. I am locked into paying $120 annually for an app I cannot access and have no customer support. I have been trying for two months to get a hold of someone with no response."
"I started learning Japanese last month, I do at least one session per day and I find that it works. I have only missed 3 days in that month and I'm usually rubbish at being consistent, so I believe speaking for myself the app has also motivated me to keep up with the extra points and badges you get when you are on a continuous strike. I only use the free version so far but I have started considering getting the one you pay for soon."
"4.5 stars good language app, understandably ad driven, learning is relatively easy and I can see that it teaches more than simple a few words or phrases but rather builds a strong language base around sentence structure and otherwise. learning is game-i-fied which appeals to my competitive nature. generally compelling lessons and lessons designed around mistakes seem like a great way to improve on repeated errors."
"It just keeps getting worse and worse. Now they messed up my progress when refreshing the course, and to top that, they removed community discussions, so now I'm always lost in my course with no help whatsoever. I feels like the app is just getting worse. They keep adding features that don't really help with the learning, and removing the ones that do."
"ƒ∞ would like to take up family plan for Duolingo super, but ƒ∞ don't want to pay over ¬£80 at once. I would like to pay monthly and be able to cancel at any time. As it is I rather not have Duolingo super family plan simply for that reason and ƒ∞ have many friends who think this same way. Please add this option and we will subscribe! ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ú®"
It's an amazing app for those who wish to take their first steps in the learning of a foreign language. It's a fun and educational tool which has clearly been made applying insights from applied linguistics and research on gamification. Congratulations to the programmers!!! Keep up the great work!!!
"Duolingo is the perfect way to learn another language. It has all the resources needed for free, and is challenging enough to make you want to continue learning. The only think that I don't like is that there are only 5 hearts. I think there should be one that is not visible-like life support. But it is overall a wonderful game and learning resources."
"pros and cons with this one folks. Fun novelty of language exercises, curriculum is different depending on when you log in. Problematically if you log in during a more experimental approach to learning you can have a real hard time learning the language. Aggressive push notifications, and long ads can make it a little lame, but for a free language tool you could certainly do worse."
"Japanese: This app is good for a couple of weeks, but it forces everyone to learn to read hiragana and katakana. Very quickly (unit 3) romanized pronunciation begins to disappear, which makes it impossible for users who only want to practice listening, because you cant do the exercises without being able to read the prompt in hiragana/katakana. I filed bug reports but never got any help from developers."
Leagues were great to keep me getting more lessons in a day than bare minimum. Now without doing lighting rounds on some other language (that has bare minimum lessons done to unlock it) 24/7 it's nearly impossible to stay in diamond with all the people that have nothing better to do or are straight up botting. Good luck without premium. Please change it back to the way it was. Rewarding us for doing old lessons.
"Though a little glitchy at times, it is pretty easy and enjoyable to learn some other languages. Also it is completely free and kind of relaxing and calm when I do it. This app is one of the greater ones on the app store and I can't understand why there are low reviews. But overall great for learning other languages fast and easily!"
"I can learn Irish anytime, anywhere for as little or as long as I want. It teaches me how to read it, say it, hear it, and surprisingly WRITE it too! There's no timer, so I can go as fast or as slow as I need to. I can go back to previous lessons and do ""practice"" lessons to earn more hearts. I get to share my progress on Facebook. It's a really cool app. I'm glad I chose to download it. I might end up subscribing. We'll see."
"There is no longer a button to access comments. This would make up for some of the wrong translations or grammar, by seeing corrections. It's gone now and we're stuck with the garbage. For the Japanese module, there are still many issues in regards to the translations. More voice acted stories would be wonderful."
Great app but sometimes the translations are wrong (I'm a native speaker of the language my child is learning) 2. There doesn't appear to be any way to turn off in-app purchases. My son has accidentally bought gems 4 times now as he just clicks on it. At the very least make it a 2-3 stage process to purchase. He's 6. 3. There is no customer service when things go wrong.
"Honestly this app was a personal favorite use everyday sort of app that was dramatically helping me stay sharp on languages I knew. and go back to frequent times a day regardless of ads I watched at the end of lessons. then they gamified it more and gave ""learning hearts"" turning it from a fun themed learning experience to stressful junk. i still get on once a day out of habit. Truly if they hadnt added the heart system time locking learning I'd have been a + member this whole 1505 day streak..."
"Great way to learn foreign languages. Set up like a game. Removing one star because too often, when you win double XP (points) for the next 15 minutes, it doesn't register for the first lesson. I can normally get through two or three lessons in fifteen minutes and this bug cuts into that significantly."
"It's a great app, the lessons are very well planned because it starts with the basics and slowly increases in difficulty which makes it easier for you to keep up. I also like the fact that it encourages competition among users which motivates them to keep learning."
"In the paid version of duolingo. It's great to practice Spanish without losing exp. That said, even In the free version. You can still earn hearts by practicing basic language exercises and watching ad's. Duolingo is a great tool to use to practice any language you want to learn."
"It's a fun way to learn languages and so you don't lose your streak it reminds you to learn every day but I hate the heart's like it's supposed to be a learning game not a pay to win game, you need to pay a certain amount of money each month just to have unlimited hearts it's really annoying, you can get unlimited hearts for free but you have to get a 1000 day streak so might as well just delete the hearts"
"I've loved using Duolingo for the last several years, I always recommend it. But for some reason as of late, the widget doesn't update to remind me to do a lesson. I've lost 3-4 freezes just to keep my streak going because of it. Is there a bug in the widget? I've removed it from my home screen and readded it, but to no avail."
Was several units in when Duolingo changed the course content without warning and arbitrary out me on a different unit with a load of words and phrases not previously covered. I had to set up a new account and start again to cover everything. This was for Scots Gaelic. Duolingo constantly wants you to pay for premium but why would I when they make such drastic changes without warning.
Pretty good with regards to the basics but you pretty much hit a brick wall due to the lack of or no speaking exercises. I've been learning greek for 7 months now and I do pretty well through the exercises. I went to cyprus and gave them a phrase I'd learnt. The waitress didn't understand me and said my pronunciation was off. Speaking is a huge part of learning a language and the most fulfilling part as it feels the hours spent learning are paying off! Sort it out duolingo
"I grew up speaking Spanish, having learned it as a 2nd language, beginning at age 8. Since finishing high school over 50 years ago, I've not had anyone to speak it with, so I've forgotten a lot. Some is coming back to me since using this app. Many of the words for things are different from the ones I'd learned. Some are words I'd never encountered before. I learned this app teaches Spanish as from Spain. Being in Texas, I'd learned Mexican Spanish. This is expanding my Spanish vocabulary MUCHO!"
The App continually fails to open and gets stuck on one screen. The only way to get it to open is to restart my phone. This is becoming more frequent to the point I'm considering getting rid of the App all together. Had this not been an issue I may have scored it higher.
"It's amazing because you can add many courses in it and it can teach you any language you are interested in. It is very good than it must be in my opinion! I love it so much, I learned from it how to talk in Japanese. I didn't think that it would put so much effort in this app, like wowüòç."
"App is fun and really addictive, but doesn't actually teach you the language. There are no dialogues whatsoever and most of the sentences to learn are hilarious and don't even make sence. Good for a game, bad for a language learning app. Like the animations, tho :)"
"I personally like dualingo because of the learning experience you get and the way they teach you is amazing. For instance there is:hearing the words,matching the words,writing the words and picking the spelling of the words.Also I can't forget that they give you so many options for different languages! I think everyone who wants to learn different languages should download dualingo now! I also rated dualingo a 5 starü§óFor Greta service too!"
The app is good for learning basic words and hearing the language spoken. However there are problems. 1) It says there is a keyboard to translate into the language but it's next to impossible to get it to show up. 2) They expect you to just pick up on different verb tenses without ever teaching them.
Super downgrading rating until they fix the issue of no xp given. It is not cool to do 20 lessons to find out you weren't given any xp for half of it. Also it keeps reseting my show pronunciation setting for Japanese lessons and it's annoying to have to go in a keep changing it back.
"So far, this app is amazing. The actual language learning part is pretty good, but the thing I love most is the fact that it only teaches you actual words that you would need. I used to learn Spanish at school, and my teacher taught me the most useless stuff imaginable. Now with this, I learnt really good phrases like how to order food or get a taxi. The only slight problem is that I did miss my streak one time and I live in constant fear of a particular green owl 'coming for a friendly chat'."
"Such a fun and easy way to learn languages for free. Especially for beginners like me who is learning European languages. Even without premium subscription, ads do not get in the way much. Keeps me wanting to take multiple lessons in one go while I have the time. So far it has been worthwhile spending time with this app as it never bores."
"Could have been a good app, has good content, but the devs are too greed, the free version have way to much ads and the limited hearts hinders learning. If it's a learning app, why keep you from studying with this limited heart system? Those things make the app very counterproductive, because to much time is spent in the repetitive lessons and wasted in 30 seconds ads every two minutes. Also, it is unnecessary woke. I just wanted to study without being hit by woke propaganda inside the lessons."
"It's fun and makes learning fairly easy, but there isn't a coherency to the lessons like in a textbook. You learn a lot of random words in each lesson. Not like a greeting conversation and then family words and food words, etc, like in school, but random. Still, I'm trying to trust the process that I can speak sentences in 6 months with some conversation. I'll update again later if it does work out."
It's an easy program to learn basic speech patterns. it's easy to use and goes over words repetitively so you learn them plus you can visit the lessons again. I would recommend this program to be exposed to the language initially and the program checks your pronunciation of the words as well.
"When I started to learn High Valyrian, I had never learned a language before. I am of Hispanic descent, hoping one day to learn Spanish and Latin. But after the multiple updates, and the lack of being able to learn the grammar, essential for learning a language. In none months I completed the HV course. But they changed it 3 times. Learning on discord that they had a guide but removed it. There are grammar rules that some of us need to learn. Why make an app for just gamers."
"The app doesn't contain feedback od courses, only for bugs. I started learning latin. The course is very short and focused on modern America, which is kind of frustrating to learn new words that are renamed american cities. Also, some sentences are non-sense, and loose the correct form in Latin. Also, translating names shouldn't be a thing, I lost perfect lesson for not translating Stephanus to Stephane and Marcus to Marce."
"In 35 days with Duolingo, I've transformed daily language learning into a fun, engaging habit. Its user-friendly interface and gamified approach kept me motivated, significantly improving my vocabulary and grammar. While it's just the beginning of my language journey, Duolingo has been an excellent starting point. Highly recommend for anyone looking to dive into a new language."
"This app is beginning to be annoying and so frustrating, after the recent update I can't use the app, it keeps saying ""offline"" even when I'm online. I uninstalled and reinstalled it and I have missed classes for some weeks now, even this recent update the issue has not been fixed, i guess to delete this app. Please fix this issue"
"Very good algorithm for learning a language. It's important to keep at the lessons. One star deducted for the frequent intrusion of ads, although you can get rid of them by subscribing. I hesitate to subscribe because it turns into an ongoing subscription that you would then have to remember to cancel when no longer needed. The interface is interesting and amusing!"
"I did Japanese for three years in school, I've picked up Duolingo now to stay sharp on all those things I learnt. While it isn't taught in the same order, I can see myself remembering more vocabulary words than I ever did in school, I highly recommend. A suggestion for Duolingo, I know it's a bit different to spoken language but I can't find any apps on Australian Sign Language which I found helpful, adding it to your list would be an untapped market and greatly appreciated."
"Super cool app, but idk what's up with the notifications because it feels like it sometimes just doesn't notify me. Plus I just did the 4 exercises to redeem my lost streak due to the missing notifications. It said I successfully got it back and then started showing me an ad. Since I was done anyway I closed the app and surprise surprise, I didn't get my streak back. Thanks for nothing."
"Very good for a free app. Could use some flexibility with certain languages. I understand that strict adherance to the conventions of one dialect is better for new learners, but it can be a hindrance for people just looking to practice a language they already know, when the particular dialect they speak is unavailable."
"This is an update after 3 months of heavy use. I think it is mostly useless for learning practical language, at least that's the case with Japanese I'm learning. It's more of a game. You kear unrelated words here and there but cannot speak. I started to play it 3 months ago with my son,and we cannot talk even super basic cos game focuses on useless things ""she is a good lawyer"" who needs this?? Anyway I'm thinking to drop this cos I don't need random words"
"It's been months that the practice button gives me the same set of sentences to translate, no change, no reply to my feedback, no hint that anyone has received it and no way to submit a bug report because both the browser and the mobile version just show an error message when I try to send one. Is anyone still running this app?"
"Why do I need to go though the exercise over and over again in different Units of a Section? This diminishes my enthusiasm of learning a new language. It begins to become boring and demotivating. With the best of intentions, I'd like to request the product owners of Super Duolingo to not make a user with somewhat above average grasping capabilities, suffer through the same exercises over and over again."
I am a Turkish English Teacher this is the Best app around to be familiar with a language and learn in to become a beginner level speaker/listener.I have a 337 days daily French learning streak and soon I will start learning French through a course to become a better speaker/listener/writer and a reader in French.I would like to thank everyone who has played a big role in the software developing and coding of this app! I was kinda sad seeing Duo git changed into a sad face but its better ü¶âü¶âü¶â
"it's a fun way to learn, but like in a pay to play kind of way. there is an advertisement after every lesson regardless of whether it took 1 min or 10 and half of the adds are to pay for duolingo in order to skip adds. the non duolingo adds are skippable after about 5 seconds. However, the duolingo adds are unskippable and 30 seconds long amd every other advertisement. im convinced their business model is trying to annoy you into either paying for or dropping the app."
"Despite some issues, which I found unacceptable to the point of saying that I wouldn't join, I am surprised by how much Spanish I have learned, and so, I most definitely am joining. Duolingo's user account/settings section terrible, & having to pay for certain tests, I don't like at all. Also, I get a free language learning app through my local library, and many words and phrases on that app are different than on this app, which I gather is due to different dialects, but it is very frustrating."
"I'm really happy to use this app. This is good learning platform for students as well as other native people. I'm requesting you that to Introduce English with English interface. That's very useful for us and many people including me, we're seeking for it! I hope your team will take this request as a consideration.Thank you!"
"Duolingo is free and I enjoy that, the ads are well placed at the end of the lessons. Sometimes I feel that the lesson should not be pushed to the hard difficulty in the middle of a lesson or the entire lesson be moved to hard. other than that most of my complaints have already been fixed. it's an actual free app and you can talk to other people while using it!"
"very good application. does not cover vosotros as it is more angled towards South America. Not enough grammar lessons embedded, which can make it difficult to know why your answer was incorrect. Takes too long to progress. You have to use it together with something that is faster and gives you more grammar rules. I use the Complete Spanish podcast from Mihalis Eleftheriou using his Language Transfer method for speed, and Coffe Break Espa√±ol to add vosotros."
It's a great app to learn the basics of a language but the further you get the worse it becomes. The start is very fun but nowadays I've been recieving many bugs were my duolingo shortcut was showing that I had completed my daily lesson but then at 10 oclock I get a notification that the streak is about to end. Please fix this thank you.
"App is designed to scam users out of coins. I just lost over 1800 coins during Match Madness without any notification of cost. The app has very poor computer generated audio which often does match native speakers. Hints are often either wrong or non-existent. I used this app for almost a years with no progress whatsoever. I don't recommend buying the app, or use it to learn language. The app oriented for gaming, not learning"
"I already know a bit of Spanish, and having a bit of time on my hands, I decided to give Duolingo a go. I am extremely pleased I did because my Spanish has improved dramatically. This method of learning has really reinforced that which l already knew, but more importantly, is advancing my understanding, vocabulary, and accuracy of the language. Give it a go."
"Love this app! The lessons combined reading, speaking, and listening. The progression is natural in terms of level for Korean, and there is emphasis put on learning syntax through repetitive sentence styles. I use this app in conjunction with a vocabulary app and I have progressed 6 levels in 2 weeks. It's also excellent for review for advanced Korean students."
It's good but I have a few gripes. Gaining a lot of points on Android is hard because lessons are worth less on Android than on iphone hence limiting you from scoring higher on the scoreboard. Lessons introduce a lot of new words each time which makes learning difficult. There is a lot less repetition as lessons go on which is the main thing that helps people remember words properly. The app keeps lagging for some reason. My wifi is fine. It's also clicking options by itself.
"It went from feeling like the Duolingo owl was going to show up at my house and beat me, to being quite an enjoyable gamified version of learning a language. It's really helping, and whilst the adverts are many, most let you skip after a few seconds, and they're not as annoying as some other apps."
"Easy to follow but uses American English, and is teaching me Mexican Spanish - would be good to have the choice for Spain Spanish (there is a difference, and not one mention of Pounds ¬£ or Euros but lots of dollars, pesos!) and don't correct my English (it's football not soccer, get over it). Occasionally says words & have to guess spelling because never been shown before, assume this is to train the ear but being failed rather than taught is an odd way to do it. And too many Duo ads for premium"
I've tried other apps like babble and wasn't a fan. This is fantastic. Some things are a bit lame but for the most part it's a solid way to learn a new language. lots of choices as well. would be nice if you could choose the type of session as a side deal like the word matching and thats what you do for your unlocked word library or whatever type you enjoy and learn best to.
I made it a habit to take 5 minutes everyday to do a lesson over the last 4 years. It's a low commitment for me but I have noticed my ability to keep up with Spanish conversations. It's a great app that helps u learn how ever fast or slow you want to go!
"I think this is probably the best language learning app there is. It helps build you're knowledge fast and covers many languages. However, it's no substitute for in person tutoring or immersion. For example, I use duolingo to practice my Italian and instead teaching the conjugation patterns of verbs, it teaches each conjugation of the verb as a separate word which is a very inefficient way to study language. It also incentivizes paying which is not something most people want from an app."
"I'm learning Japanese, but if you want to know why you get an exercise wrong, look elsewhere (like Busuu). The ""guidebook"" gives you key phrases (to memorize) rather than actual explanations of grammar or advanced sentence structure. Additionally, within a year I hadn't practiced (I ended a 376 streak back in 2022), the beginning lessons seem to think that knowing ""a cool lawyer"" is more important to know than ""he"" or ""she"". I mostly use it for learning to write Kanji now."
"The app has improved in speed, and now has speed drills in every unit, so that I can focus my practice where I think I need more. I wish that I could bank the 15 minute double points windows, to use when I am free, the way that the app lets me bank the 30 minute double points window for completing the friends' quest."
"I'm unable to practice words that I've learned in the app. I just get the message ""an error has occurred"" when I try to. Samsung 23 Ultra. Beyond that, the app works well, but I want to reinforce what I have learned outside of the lessons! I've tried to contact the developers, but I have not had any replies. I will update my review when this issue is resolved. I am a super duolingo user."
"The blocking animations after every single lesson are a waste of our time. Speech detection ain't what it used to be Often gets stuck and fails to detect the first few words again and again even when speaking the language perfectly. Seems to be some sort of glitch, results in lost hearts and less practice."
"it is such a great app. it really helped me to improve my full korean. I'm Indian but I know korean now, there are so many languages, you can choose your favourite one, or any language to know it for fun or for other purposes. You all can believe me that it is really a wonderful app. thank uh Duolingo for making me understand the korean. I was also thinking that it is not real, and I was not interested in it. but when I used it for once, I found that it is a very good app.Thankuh once again.üíåüíó"
"I like it but the part about ma'am being 2 separate words threw me off... I lost points and I'm pretty sure it isn't 2 words... Ma and 'am were 2 different selections for senorita... Also the pictures can be deceiving, the one with the cat holding a credit card is confusing because it's a cat not a human... made me think it was disturbing the person's study so I chose ""study"" instead of ""pay""... cats don't use credit cards so it wasn't clear enough what was going on in the photo."
"This app takes full advantage of gamification to urge you on in language learning. It covers reading, writing, listening, and speaking. It also helps you figure out vocabulary and grammar in a natural way. This is a great app for starting a new language. Definitely worth the reasonable cost for the upgrade if you are serious about learning."
"Progress reset, came back after a while and all my progress on japanese was reset and the new system of hearts is plain ****, the grammar hasn't improved a bit and i can understand adds but the constant interruption is extremely disruptive a small add could have been set at the very bottom of the screen generating revenue without interfering as much as it does now"
"The app doesn't allow you to practice to earn hearts so you can complete your lessons. The ads to purchase super Duolingo are pushed constantly and I feel like they purposely give you errors to make you lose your hearts so you'll be tempted to purchase their program without ads and unlimited hearts. On several occasions I have chosen the correct answer and I receive an error. Then when I put the answer they showed, I'm given another error with my original answer as the correct one."
"I like how Duolingo lets you learn languages in a fun and often engaging way, especially with the leaderboards giving a competition. Personally, I would put in a language comparison feature for people who are learning multiple languages with the app to compare words that mean the same thing in the Native Language, and the other languages learnt by the app. Kind of similar to the ipad and computer versions, but with more features and word specification. Other than that, I think it's great."
"well it's good, sometimes the constant reminder emails are annoying and sometimes they use the same examples again and again and sometimes they also introduce a lot of new words at once but other than that it's ok and the audio of radio shows is too quick sometimes."
"it's an amazing application for learning languages. it's very interactive and fun with less Ads. I recommend it to everyone who is interested in learning any language offered by this amazing platform. I should I rated it 5 stars but I'm still learning french on this app. and I'll rate it 5 üåü Once I completed my french course. merci beaucoup, Duolingoüòò"
"Easy and gamified way to learn any language. Great community and several users. My only issue is it doesn't count how often you took a lesson per day, and only focuses on streaks. I, as well as some of my friends with busy lifestyles, would like to keep count of how many days I signed in for a lesson, and not focus on prioritizing my streak once i lose my streak, I suddenly lose interest in learning the language itself through duolingo"
"It's good, but what makes this a stress is the lives you get when incorrect, I thought this was a learning app, not a testing app, I want to learn languages, not be tested every second with a second timer and a life counter, I wish there was a way of not dealing with that issue, I'm not a fast learner, my mind can only handle a certain amount of sentences before it gives up. Please just make a regular learning app."
Duolingo is extremely beneficial!! You can practice learning languages everyday with Duolingo!!! I am so happy that I decided to download the app yesterday. You can learn so many languages with Duolingo. I made a commitment and I will stick to the commitment daily! I even invited my friends and families to also download Duolingo to learn languages!!! There are 500M+ people that downloaded the app Duolingo and I would encourage you to do so also!!! The app Duolingo is very fun and interactive!
"After using this app with Hebrew for almost a year, I dropped a star. They are very, very good with some things but not so good in others. For the Hebrew, they have ""practice your words"" launched, but it doesn't work at all on the Android app and is only semi-functional on the web (no audio). They are not good at responding to user feedback, either. After I have completed a year, I will probably drop my paid subscription and move to a different platform."
"This is a great app for learning because it definitely involves all the things that you need; recall, writing, movement, listening, speaking üó£Ô∏è ... My one gripe is that the lessons teach you really odd stuff in the beginning! The beginning lessons of Portuguese/German involve animals... Can I get some directions? Or perhaps food? Basic lessons should be common things, no learning how to say ""owl or monkey!"""
"Learning japanese, and while it is fairly efficient, i have my critiques about it. 1. I am an extremely fast learner, and the fact you need to complete basically the same lesson around 9 times before moving on is annoying. I master the words in 2 lessons and cannot move on to the next lesson. 2. It disallows creativity in translations and most forced sentences sound unnatural. (""On weekends, i swim"" instead of ""i swim on weekends"")"
"If you haven't used Duolingo for several years, take another look, especially in Spanish. There is more in the app to teach you the language from beginner level then there used to be. I wish the app still allowed users to discuss the questions and answers, because I used to learn a lot from reading those discussions. Now I can't even see them."
"Fine app for beginners, but not ideal for people with intermediate knowledge of a language who are seeking to improve. There is a ""pre test"", however, it does not properly assess your knowledge or place you accordingly. I've taken 2 years of Japanese and was hoping to learn new words, and it's instead teaching me the alphabet. There is no way to skip it. I found it does this with every language that has a foreign alphabet."
"This is an amazing app. I love learning new languages on it. It also let's you fix a mistake which helps the learning process. I wish there were more listening and Repeating. I am someone who can easily learn a word phrase or sentence in another language by listening and Repeating several times. I'm sure I'm not the only person that can learn this way. Overall, this is an app I use regularly! Thank you to the creators that made Duolingo üòä"
honestly works better than any other language app I have used. it's very user friendly and the pointless competition of it makes me want to learn it more and get it correct. I would recommend this app if you want to learn it with friends as it will help along with conversating as well.
"The app is good but could really use some real grammar lessons, you pretty much have to figure out the language rules on your own or buy a separate grammar book. The leagues and points are a major distraction to learning a language but thankfully you can opt out of them"
"I personally think this is a cool app and I'm currently learning polish just for fun and I'm enjoying it. but I'm not happy about the fact that you need hearts to do lessons..... because the whole point of the app is to learn a new language, not to be playing a game. you can't even do a lesson without a heart wich is ridiculous because I'm not here to have to wait 4 hours before I get ONE heart back. also I wish there was an option where you could watch adds to get hearts and not have to pay."
"good for learning languages and fun too! makes learning like a game, which helps remember. but it doesn't really doesn't tell you/explain grammar for languages. like French and German, it expects you to know the difference between words like ""mein/meine"" and the correct way to use them without telling you."
"It certainly helps with languages but I recommend you go do classes studying the languages with it. There's a lot that's left unexplained and it just kind of lets you learn it yourself. If you solely use Duolingo to learn a language from scratch, you aren't going to get anywhere. You can't really use it on its own but it is good enough. That being said though, if you already know a little bit of the language or languages you are learning; I'll have to recommend it."
"Those commercials are way to frequent and annoying. Can you play them maybe once per session . If that frequency continues I just may have to switch to something else. Also why can't I use my Google rewards money to by one month of Duolingo at the time. You would make more money from me that way then you are making now. Otherwise ,app is fun and makes learning new languages fun."
"Exceptionally good ü§ç but it could be better if there was a lifetime subscription offer for Super duolingo, but overall, it's amazing, and the vocabulary is top tier. I am now currently learning Dutch, and I learned it at a much faster rate than I initially expected üòÖ"
"What sets Duolingo apart is its gamified approach to learning. Instead of feeling like a chore, each lesson feels like a challenge to conquer. The variety of exercises keeps things interesting, from listening and speaking practice to reading and writing tasks."
I got Duolingo back in 2018 to learn pirate and it was super fun. But now it's ads all the freaking time. Long ads too. And there are less opportunities to refill to keep learning. The goal shifted from helping people learn to making money so I don't enjoy it as much anymore.
"In the beginning, the app was great, but recently, unfortunately, it has started to change. I don't know why, and they don't seem to care about the comments that users write because they have a lot of users. I'd appreciate it if you could provide options to hide or show any sentence at any step if a user wants to skip it because the word is easy or for some other reason. We need to challenge ourselves, not make it too easy, and we need speaking practice more than anything else."""
"after using this app for over a year i do not feel more confident in my understanding of another language. often i am prompted to show i understand what a spoken word is in wrotten form - without telling me what it means in english. i have not learned sentence structure, grammer rules, or other such things that could help me translate a phrase. and there is no opportunity to speak the language and try to get pronounciation right. the app is cute and the lessons are short, but I'm not learning."
"I'm having fun brushing up on Spanish, while learning German and Italian for the first time. In person classes have their advantages, but this ap is a fantastic way to learn if that isn't an option. I would also recommend it as a good thing to use in addition to in person learning."
Duolingo is a very useful app especially for the people like me who can't afford to take courses to learn different foreign languages. I really appreciate the efforts of the makers of this app who helped us by investing their skills and ideas. Thanks and congrats to the team duolingo!!!
"With the last update it quickly escalated to discouragement to even want to compete with my own numbers. The push to buy grew intense with the last update as well, after every lesson an advertisement with more steps to back out before proceeding with lessons. The point system fell back to what feels almost unfair to compete with those who can actually afford to pay the big ticket. I don't know, it almost feels too greedy on the other end now to want to continue."
"The app is great and all, but this is a message for the devs, I'm currently studying mandarin Chinese, and i encountered a bug. Whenever it's time to the speaking exercise, it just stops recording and then marks it wrong, please fix this bug."
"Duolingo offers a diverse range of languages and the application has a user friendly interface. Although it lacks 2 languages I was looking forward to learning it's still a very educative and useful app, I personally would recommend it."
"I used to be able to turn off speaking and listening exercises. I am still able to turn off listening exercises, but am being forced to do speaking exercises. There are so many situations that I can't do speaking exercises in. I do my lessons in silent most days. This is making it impossible to even do the lessons."
"best rider trip language learner or there. so it with my 4 year old to stay engaged. hes on trac to be fluent in 4 languages by the time he's 10. French, Spanish, German, and Arabic. Plus English as the main. so it works if you engage daily like it's a challenge. try to stay in the top 10 on the leader board to stay consistent. also I suck at grammar, get over it that's a different app."
"Literally BEST APP EVER for learning a language for newbies and for free. Ô∏éÔ∏éÔ∏éÔ∏éÔ∏éÔ∏é Duolingo is not that type of applications which makes most of the accesments requires subscriptions literally the opposite! They gave me free 3 days of Super Duolingo and I feel happy with it, because I could try it for free. Ô∏éÔ∏éÔ∏éÔ∏éÔ∏éÔ∏é I'm a native Arabic speaker and I could never develop my English-speaking without that app. Ô∏éÔ∏éÔ∏éÔ∏éÔ∏éÔ∏é And right now I'm learning french and I'm having an amazing experience :D!"
"I love how the course is structured. I had some minor issues using the app, when I tried to use 'Practice to Earn Hearts' function, the app always show there's error occurred. Sometimes this issue will persist for weeks."
"I love the APP. It's simple lessons encourage me to believe I can do it. I love the creative ways Duo drags you back to study. I feel so bad when I see him looking unhappy and dejected,always get back to studying to see if I can bring out a happy face ü§£üòÇ. I love the placing on the league too. Helps me want to work harder for a better position. Wonderful APP"
Best language app out there! Very intuitive and engaging with its lessons while making it feel almost video game-like! Not to mention it's free! Overall a very fun and cute top notch language learning app to better yourself and a great way to spend your free time!
"coming back to this app after a while, like 5 years, and really impressed how elaborate the curriculum and exercises have become. Right now I'm just preparing for travel like I wanna be able to order a coffee without needing my phone or resorting to English and the exercises get you to that point fairly directly."
"Makes learning actually happen. Structured in a motivating way to persevere. there are glitches sometimes with the software, but they work in my favor in terms of competitive advantage at least as much as they work against me, so I take it in stride."
"I have been at it only a week and can already carry on some conversation. The layout makes it easier to pick up on by providing verbal, written, and visual prompts. When spelling, be sure to spell correctly and use accent marks appropriately."
"Was a fun, helpful app, but mic stopped working, so uninstalling and looking for something that works. I've since gone through all settings in Duo and on phone, followed all advice online, spent hours trying to fix, but mic capabilities still not working."
"Once you get to the highest level, it's just the same ten phrases that keep alternating. that's so frustrating! it was much better before they changed it all a year or two ago, when you could decide for yourself which lesson to do."
"Overall pretty decent. I have one major issue tho, when using the audio functions the words are cropped too far so similar words sound nearly identical. It would be best if the words had a pause before and after so we get to hear the complete word."
"The audio is disappeared and the support team just ignores me. I wrote them a bunch of letters for 2 weeks. I sent reports. Duo doesn't care. Support team doesn't care about you. They just broke the core functionality. Awfully unprofessional behavior. And removing the discussions. Why?? It feels like they are silently taking the free version's Installation resources in favor of the paid ones (for schools, etc). Duolingo is just getting actually worse."
"I just want to say that Duo has gotten a lot better, but don't just use Duolingo as your only source. Remember, learning a language requires practice both in the app and communicating. Find writing and reading materials. Find a mentor or a friend in your targeted language. Also why are you learning? ask yourself that question. Duolingo is good for people to see which language they want to learn and to stay on track. Currently studying Spanish, Chinese, and Korean.Gracias,Duo por t√π duro trabajar"
It's a good app to practice. but I have a request that if you guys can introduce an exam time setting. I am not saying that streaks should be maintained but if a student is having his university exams then he can just turn on exam time mode... So that notifications don't bother him all the time.
"great app to practice what you study in a class. The only thing I would change is that when tapping words to make a sentence, if you want to rearrange a word, it doesn't allow you and you have to start the sentence all over again."
It's a bit creepy if you watch there YouTube channel but other wise i realy recommend it for learning a new language! If you lose your streak for a long time you might forget what you learned and you'll have to do it again but it's a ten out of ten learning game!
"Well, it was fairly decent, but I have 1 problem: The ads! While I do know they are here for the sweet income, I just hate how unsuitable the ads are, like imagine a ad with LOUD lazer SOUNDS playing and INNERUPTING your MINDFUL LEARNING OF ANY LANGUAGE. Yeah. That occurred to me. Plus, I'm (double digit), and I have phonophobia. So that ad startled me a lil bit."
I've been learning with duolingo for nearly four years now. I have no complaints about the app. It's easily the best money spent all year. It's paid off in more learning than I could have ever expected. I love it.If you're consistent with the lessons on a daily basis you can't help but learn!
this app is the most perfect app to learn any language free.i had a dream of learning japnese since my childhood but I never went to a class or an opportunity to learn japnese but with Duolingo my childhood dream is completed. the only thing I sometimes get angry about with Duolingo is the hearts system but otherwise it is the best app .and if you are thinking of downloading this app for forward and do it cause this app completes incomplete dreams and opportunity to learn any language.
My kid got to gold of the board in silver league and at the last minute someone gets ahead of her.That's fine no problem but it happens again. I noticed this same person has gotten well over 1000 points this time due to them having unlimited hearts subscription. Another thing this person never consistently practices but all of a sudden when my kid gets to the top that person takes it by HUNDREDS of points.Why when it changes to a new board this person is nowhere to be found in the next league...
This app is perfect for learning languages it repeats the sentences so you won't forget. It does know every single word but except for japanese but that's ok and it is a little easy to know what they're saying. This is pretty fun and very useful.
"I'm giving up on this app. I used to practice daily but I noticed tiny issues, such as not accepting when I misspelled a word and what not, essentially things that I really can't be upset at. With that being said once I began the French lessons the little bit that I did know was being taught incorrectly but was able to power through. I'm doing German now, when I get to one specific activity where it's ""Ich ____ ___"" I'm unable to do anything, and after trouble shooting, I'm finally over it."
"I rate this a 5 stars because one duolingo is my pookie, two duolingo helps me a lot. I'm practicing Haitian creole and I'm already learning sentences without even thinking! this app is great and highly recommend if u want to become bilingual. the only problem is that every day I miss a lesson have to restart but other than that...100000% RECOMMEND"
In the beginning I went nuts competing in all the leagues. Now I've settled into a steady state of doing a couple of lessons per day to maintain my streak and get the monthly badges. It's a nice way to learn at a steady and sustainable pace.
"I've got a long streak, so I can't quit - but Duo: the ""straight path"" method is BORING. It was much more interesting to choose my own lessons. I keep getting free passes for ""super"" Duo, but nothing there gives the lessons any more spice. Please mix it up!"
I like the stuf and the missions that i have to do daily. I like the mechanic with gems but I didn't like that u could not buy more things. Also the prizes keeps me in-game every day since 1 week ago. I will keep playing and learning. I'll advice the developers to bring skins for Duo back. Even there are some kind of things that I don't agree with my rating is 5 out of 5 just because it's funny. I'll appreciate if y'all bring more stuff. Congrats!!
Very good learning app. Doesn't make you fluent in the language but very close to it. I wrote in an early comment that I cannot invite friends and they fixed it since. Generally very good and also includes some fictional languages which is fun.
"I have nearly achieved a full year using the app. Im sure it has taught me a lot of Spanish. However, recently, when I try to select words to complete a conversation, it doesn't allow me and whatever I press goes red. I have no choice but to submit what I know is a wrong answer."
"Duolingo is fun but for some reason the app icon looks very sad at the moment so only giving 3 stars. I'm about to delete it because I can't stand looking as the sad face of this owl and it didn't seem to cheer him up when I did a lesson. Also, the app. makes me click ""I am comitted"" if I want to continue when I'm not really that committed. Might just delete, despite it being an otherwise great app."
"Tbh the hearts have to go. Personally I feel like it's not a GREAT learning too. Especially if you're learning it for fun, I get kinda unmotivated to do my lessons when I lose all of my lives to my korean lessons. Also I lost my first place roll to a super user with 500! I only have 200 xp and it's kinda hard to accumulate xp when you have hearts and needs to use gems to get more or get double xp stuff. So honestly please get rid of the hearts üò≠üôè please Duolingo."
"Don't understand how this app has a 4.7 rating. I have lived in Spain for 25 years, I speak Spanish pretty well, do not have a problem with the Spanish understanding me nor me understanding them. Yet this app always says I pronounce it incorrectly and the apps pronouciation isn't always clear to me. My friend who's sitting next to me and is from Venezuela cannot understand why it says incorrect, I've tried saying it slow and normal. Some of the speakers accents are definitely not from Spain."
"Absolutely amazing app to learn on! Reccommend 100%! It really doesn't have any ads except for a few super duolingo pop ups which are never in the middle of lessons, it is always fun to learn with, and that's pretty much it, definitely recommend!"
"So I wanted to re ignite my passion for learning languages having not done any in over 20 years. I chose German as that was what I learnt at school so know the basics. well I love how the app works as in you go over the same words in sentences several times so it sinks in alot of the words are very similar to ours. this will become an addition as I hope to become fluent and once I have will learn a second language, one I've never learnt before. absolutely fantastic app and happy to pay"
"Bad things about recent Duolingo: removed forums and comments, a lack of grammar materials, some bugs. The app settings do nothing. A lot of animations is annoying, you cannot turn them off, so do speaking exercises and other things."
"Great app, ads are not too oppressive even on the free mode and the Spanish (Edit: and German) course is great. Though I will admit that Duolingo is a lot weaker for languages that don't use English characters (Chinese, Japanese)"
Duolingo is great cuz you can actually learn languages unlike other apps that claim to do the same but does not and also in doulingo you can even learn how to right in this languages but it doesn't have all languages sadly but an other good thing about Duolingo is that you can get super Duolingo for free for three days if you finish your goal and if your new!‚úåÔ∏è
"It started off excellent, I loved learning and would feel ashamed to miss out a day. I gave it 5* before but it changed and all my progress was removed. They don't allow us to use our profile pictures anymore and force us to use avatar. I felt tricked and locked into having an avatar. It's really not nice. I felt very dumb when I tried the avatar and realised I can't revert to a photo. They made it unenjoyable and I saw people quit. I feel like the features are getting worse."
"Keeps bugging me about paying for their premium subscription. Also doesn't have the music lessons on androids, only on iphone which was annoying when I made the switch to android. The hearts system is a significant barrier to learning and should not be a feature."
"Love Duolingo. But sometimes Duolingo doesn't start (edit:) This is following getting notification that a chest is available. Duo comes up with green background then blue background because I've paid, then hangs. I have to restart my phone in order to use Duolingo and of course ironically, the chest is locked!"
"I think it's a very educational app that has tons of languages to learn. The fact that you can learn Latin,Klingon and High Valyrie is amazing. 10 out of 10 recommend for beginners of a language. also I was definitely not paid to write this ..."
No words to say about duolingo is a very great teaching app with beautiful game actually this is the new thought it is very helpful for everyone . This make perfect by keeping steaks and challenges . And it has even may languages that go like an unit like general textbooks in school but the feelof this duolinga unit exercise feels good for everyone . Duolingo is very very good app for language learning thank u duolingo for this beautiful opportunity to learn ‚ù§ ‚ô• . It like very much ... üòä
"Could be better, too many words to learn at once and no real time to really understand the meaning of things and put it in correct context before moving on the next topic. Good recall of random words but not helpful for fluency. Would be good if it had a this is what you said and this is what it should say in the corrections so I can see where I have gone wrong, esp with same words that mean different things. Going over topics doesn't help if there's no explanation or context."
"it's a great app for studies or future travell. As they told,it is like a game. It doesn't even feel like you're learning language , it just fell like playing a game . But in the end , you do learn a language Overall an amazing app . Highly recommend this app for learning languages"
"Excellent nice and helpful app for language learners. I started learning languages from Duolingo since 4 years ago.nice experience. to stay here and continually learning is very tough.you have to learn language and participate in compitition.i achieveed many achievements in duo.in February 2, 3 4 my friends achieved"" year of dragon"" achievement but I didn't.so I would like to achieve that also .help me please.how can I achieve that again and how could I get opportunity to achieve it again.thanks"
"This app is so well made for learning Spanish especially. The design is amazing and the lessons are easy and repetitive so you can remember them. I haven't been using it long, but this app is just amazing and helps you so much with learning languages."
"Recently started and went with the paid version, free version was great but I prefer the additional features. So far it seems fun and educational, helps me track progress and stay on track. I do recommend this app."
"It's clear that English was not a strong suit for the creators, with some correct answers being rejected and sometimes demanding answers in bad English. The foreign language skills of the app's creators isn't very strong either (depending on language), sometimes rejecting correct answers and insisting on wrong ones. Using this app to refresh myself on languages I was formally taught gives me anxiety."
"I'm a bit disappointed about how duolingo had changed. Now, they makes some lessons g√¶, and they do not show mistakes at all. They show way more ads than they used to and they only teach vocab. Honestly, try babbel or some other language app. Don't install!"
I love the app and it makes language learning easy however I made the mistake of clicking on one of the ads and have now been charged multiple times for purchases I did not make. I'm surprised such a well-crafted app could allow such a b*******.
"I love it, it couldn't be any better other than hearts running out to quickly, maybe allow for more typos in beginners levels. The funny stories keep it very engaging. it honestly couldn't be any more perfect for learning."
"Duolingo is an amazing app to learn languages, and it's also fun to learn languages here. The way you progress through the language is really cool, and you can even learn multiple languages at once. Duolingo is one of my favorite apps I use every day."
"This app is wonderful for all ages and encourages people to learn new languages and have real life conversations the only cons I have is if you don't buy or want super Duolingo there are many adds for it but they don't usually pop up, next some words they encourage you to keep learning you don't often use other than that this app gets a 5/5"
"They need a dyslexic or vision impairment box you can check. I cannot pass the 2ed lession because i cant spell. I cant even spell the english words. I learn through auditory functions so i would just want to speak the words instead of type. It makes it more frustrating that i cannot do this app due to the focus on written comprehension, which is the area i naturally learn last"
"Duolingo is a good app for me to learn German. I am thankful for the phenomenal effort it must be to produce an app like this . Why did I rate 4 stars instead of 5: I'm British and for me ‚öΩÔ∏è represents football not soccer. Likewise üç™ is a biscuit and üçü are chips etc. The gamification is good but I prefer to ignore the league tables as I tend to focus on winning points instead of learning. The Duolingo blog writes about inclusivity but the app lacks Jews, Christians, Hindus or Buddhists."
"such a great way to learn. Duo has written, spoken and audio lessons of a steady build up of words to increase you language skills with a thorough understanding of aural and written word as well as pronunciation. I'm picking it up quite quickly. I feel like I'm well on my way to being reasonably fluent."
"In your own time, will attempt to keep you motivated and structured in a way that you can't help but learn. No explanation for grammar rules but you will slowly pick them up. A little Google search can give you more if needed but not necessary. Plus, I enjoy üëç"
I don't get speaking or typing exercises. I have never had them despite having all the settings on and I've done all the troubleshooting I could think of. I've tried emailing a couple of times with no response. I've been using this app since 2019.
"Honestly, best learning app in my opinion. It has streaks and leagues that keep me encouraged and gets harder as you learn. Even without Duolingo Super the app felt complete, and had mostly everything I needed. 10/10 and extra points because of the silly green birb"
Great app and I found it useful to give me at the very least a useful vocabulary and a store of useful phrases. Just wish they would change the voices more frequently. Also too much goodie goodie social commentary which gets annoying.
app glitches sometimes but not bad overall. I like the overall format and I have learned a lot in a short time. I really hate the mini animations with the radio DJs. it's actually teeth grating.
it's a funny app for learning we can learn anything from it ‚ò∫Ô∏è anything we want Duolingo keep it up.all those who can't learn in school they can learn from Duolingo with no price it is a very great thing and I am learning Korean from it.it is very easy for me to learn Korean because of Duolingo I was not able to learn in class so after listening peoples review for Duolingo I also tried it for the first time and it was very helpful for me. it's a very helpful app everyone should download it‚ò∫Ô∏è ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Duolingo is an exceptionally engaging and effective language learning platform. Its accelerated teaching methods and absence of disruptive advertisements enhance the learning experience. I highly recommend Duolingo and encourage you to explore language learning opportunities for your personal and professional growth.
"I've gotten stuck in s glitch cycle with the Arabic course where it keeps asking me to repeat a passing test, decides that I do indeed succeed and the still makes me retake the test endlessly. Otherwise a good app, lots of improvements since the last time I used it."
"This is a wonderful app. Please, I do hope that the app will have a feature where we learners can interact with one another. Also, my connection is great but when it comes to Duolingo, it just stops working."
"The exercises are useful. I could do without the over the top animations. having exercises locked behind micro transactions is grating, especially when I paid for two weeks to avoid having my ""health"" go down with mistakes"
This app is so good for helping you learn new languages and keep your language studies up. I have only been using Duolingo for almost 2 weeks and have already learned heaps. I would definitely recommend this app to any one who is looking to learn a new language or help themselves with education.
"Fun app, but i started losing interest because of how little context they provide in practice. Duolingo does not practice conversational terms and phrases but rather weird and oddly specific words and sentences you would rarely use. What happened to the basics like "" have you eaten? """
I like Duolingo super duelingo is good you don't get ads with super duelingo you also get personalized lessons and you can do as many languages as you want at a time with regular duolingo it is very fun and I enjoy it they have widgets for your home screen to remind you to do doing go to get a streak my best streak has been probably 18 and it is very helpful so in conclusion you should probably get Duolingo if you're looking to get a new app and learn a new language
After the last update the courses changed a little bit. I have no problem with the update by itself but my problem comes with it jumping me ahead quite a bit and I am now in courses with words and phrases that I have never been through. Please fix the issue.
"LESS ABOUT LEARNING MORE ABOUT MONEY! Since the latest update, you're limited on how many mistakes you can make per lesson (using hearts) as well as making more lessons pay-to-play (using gems) making learning incredibly hard for free users (regardless of these being free before). Not suprised as most apps are going this way but disappointed in Duolingo for succumbing to it. Only using it for 2 mins a day due to my 1200+ day streak but using other apps to learn & recommend you do the same."
Getting super duo is totally worth the cost. Being able to have personalised lessons on words and phrases that you're weak at is invaluable for getting more proficient. The interface is really user friendly too.
I started yesterday just to try it out and already realized when i came back to do 2 more 3 to 5 minute exercises i had already learned 4 words and 4 characters in Japanese.... I'm pleasantly surprised by how well its working so early. I hope I'm able to maintain this kinda pace throughout the rest of the process. loving the app so far!
"Overall, I really like this app. HOWEVER, that being said, it has some SERIOUS glitches. On Saturdays, we get an hour of five extra points for each lesson we do. I just spent half an hour where I should have been getting 50 points per lesson and yet I got NO points and I will never receive the points I should have (I know this from previous experience). Duolingo, please fix these glitches (especially when someone is paying for it). Also, seriously? I can learn Klingon, but I can't learn Tagalog?"
Shuts down unexpectedly in the middle of exercises; marks speaking wrong (often twice) but when you say it again exactly the same way it's suddenly correct. Never an admin response to positive feedback or criticism. Fun learning but can be frustrating.
I used to recommend this app to everybody and then they changed the crowns back in 2018 luckily I could still use APK mirror and use the original one that didn't make you repeat the same thing over and over again now that's not available anymore so you have to do the new version that makes you repeat things way too much. They need to let use whatever version we want to be it the new one the original or crowns .
"I actually feel like I'm learning more when compared to other apps, yet the freezing after a commercial put the damper on that if you have to restart it, making feel uncertain if you've received what you earned. Overall I enjoyed this app."
"I love this app, nearly a 650 day streak. it's good at what it does. I would go premium but I dislike the billing options, id rather pay 5.99 a month than one surplus every year. if that became a feature I would say premium is very worth the price"
"I'm having problem with keypad input: it makes my input wrong even I spelled the words right. For example, for the word ""Hello"" in Spanish ""Hola"" The l is switched to another font style of ""l"" (A font style that might resembles ""1"") Which considers my answers wrong, also for the word ""gracias"""
"I have given it 4 stars because this app is very good for learning English but my message is to its developer that updating its logo is not good, the old logo was better than this so please Change this and use the old logo , this is not having any positive effect in my mind Hardly anyone would have liked this because it is not attractive. Being an old user of this app, I am sharing my opinion, I hope someone will change it. Thankyou."
"this app As awesome any language you wanna learn is very easy. It's easy, it's easy for anyone to use. Since it has lessons for bikinis and if you want to continue learning, they also have lessons for you. The lessons are easy and you can lend them at any age."
"Duo is a powerful tool for breaking into a new language. It won't take you to full fluency, but it is an absolutely amazing primer for further study that is painless and easy to incorporate into your day and by the time you complete a full course in a given language, you'll be proficient enough to speak and be understood."
Constant ads and weird sentence structures. Teaches you 10+ new words in one lessons and giving you complex sentences immediately expecting you to fail so you buy premium. Gives you words that people don't use as its too formal and doesn't teach you proper replies till much later on. So you learn how to say single words like a baby and not how to from sentences that people actually use.
"I enjoy the app, but I'd like to see fairness on the Leaderboards. People seem to have worked a way to hack it, I can't imagine someone spends 10 hours a day... I was on one and they had 33000 points within a few days... its ridiculous, you could watch them get 1000 points in about 15 mins, ... plus, listening to the English learning. Its American, not English as such. Words used such as 'major' in studying is an American word not English. I think you need to differentiate the two."
"As an Native Norwegian speaker, i find the norwegian courses very good. Even though i speak norwegian, its good to keep your vocabularies sharp! anyways, Duolingo is a very, VERY good app for learning languages! Its user friendly, and it includes character customization too. I absolutely recommend this."
"I have an auditory processing disorder so I have a hard time with the spoken portions, but thankfully I can slow them down! My only complaints are that I don't know how to access the tips and tricks so I keep making small mistakes and losing hearts over it, and the leagues are kind of pay to win as well. I never thought I'd see a pay to win learning app."
"This app is kind of okay, but it's missing the essential explanation of why there are 5 different worlds for every different thing that mean the same thing but change according to whether you're talking about I, you, he she it, we, you plural, and they. Until this is explained clearly, these lessons make almost no sense. Thank God my wife knows Spanish, and the rules are very similar, so she could explain it to me."
I love how Duolingo keeps up with learners' needs. Lessons are quite interesting and useful. I would just love it if there were fewer exercises for the lessons that a learner has already perfected. It can get a bit boring.
"Duolingo is a useful app to learn a new language. if you use the free tier, expect a lot of ads. I do understand they have to pay the bills somehow, and they do give a lot for free. btw I love their social media team... And the duolingo bird is definitely not forcing me to write this review at gun point. I'd never give them 5 stars because my life is being threatened. DUO GIVE BACK MY FAMILY PLEASE I DID WHAT YOU ASKED!!!"
"The icon is kind of creeping me out right now, so I changed it to the larger icon that encourages you to practice every day. Some languages have more units and lessons than others. Like Spanish has a lot more lessons than Ukrainian. It may be because there are a lot more similarities between Spanish and English alphabets than Ukrainian Cyrillic. So it's a lot more difficult for English speakers to learn. I may try to learn it again in the future because I know there is a lot I forgot."
I was shocked to know that a friend of mine actually learned to speak a foreign language fluently through using this app. It's because I always thought it was some sort of scam but really it just takes perseverance and hard work! It also takes a great teacher or app. Thanks Duolingo!
a very bad app for learning . if you accidentally miss more then a day then you will run out of streak freezes . that's what happened with me. I had a 16 day streak and it got reset to zero. never download this app if you are a busy person.
This was recommended by my daughter for me to learn Spanish. it's an excellent app! Repetition is key and this app addresses learning styles for the learners. Duolingo let's you learn at your own pace yet encourages and motivate you not to linger too long . For me this is a WINNER. Adios
I honestly loved using this app to learn a variety of new languages. The only reason I haven't given this app 5 stars is because it doesn't cover the Afrikaans language. There is a big market being left unexplored here. There aren't any good apps to learn Afrikaans despite it being a vital language for those living and visiting South Africa. Especially for those living in the Western Cape. I hope to see this language added to the app soon.‚ù§Ô∏è
"Improved my english with the duolingo to a good extent. Only disappointment is that it doesn't level up with the difficulty even after I having nearly 50,000 points. So it frustrates me a lot to practice things I know very well."
"At first I was going to give it 4-5 stars, but then the feature of allowing me to practice to earn hearts stopped working. I haven't been able to practice to earn hearts in over a week, which is very discouraging for practice. I read that many people had a similar issue - Duolingo's way to trying to force you to use a paid version, but this is terrible and discourages people from practicing. now I have to wait 4 hours before I can continue my practice."
Annoying. Stories are gone. Also we can't skip ahead to further steps if we already know the words. We have to do the exercises even if we don't want. Sad. Also Duolingo uses the same old teaching model. That hasn't changed fundamentally. Makes it boring.
"Umm.... I downloaded the app again a few days back, and I've completed unit 1. Yippy. Now I want to procede to unit 2 and it tells me to do a test thingy based on what I learnt in unit 1. I did the test with no problems but it keeps on telling me to do that same test over and over again without letting me through to unit 2. Wth?! Fix this please!ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüò≠. It's the only reason why I gave this 4 stars and not 5 cuz this app is PERFECT. I've learnt quite a bit of French already. Just pls fix this üò≠"
It is very helpful and iam going to be a one year learner this week... But the new change of decreasing hearts for mistake is cruel ...that unlimited version was good...also there are many ads and promotions for subscription.
I like the app a lot but I'm a little disturbed by some of the ads that Duolingo allows on their platform. There are sexually suggestive ads that are clearly marketing toward young boys that appear from time to time. This is an educational app that is supposed to be safe for everyone.
"In Duolingo, languages are very easy and interesting to learn. And the reminders are really helpful. This is like a fun game. But yeah definitely you should add an option to choose only to speak and listen or also to read and .... some ... good"
"it's an amazing app it's really helping me learn different languages and it's so fun with all these characters they have but I don't really like the way that I have to learn the same thing every day it's getting boring I'm in the first level but still it's the same thing every day but it's a very good app I just want to say it's good, but I don't think I'll have a lot of progress in a month. regards ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∏üáø"
"I've been learning Japanese for over a year and while not fluent, learned some key phrases that helped me on my trip to Japan. Duolingo makes the learning fun and builds the habit. To become fluent though you'll likely need to supplement your learning."
"truly an amazing app! you don't even need the paid version to be able to have incredible features. I think the best part about it is that it's continual fun, and there's always something new! it's such a wonderful way to learn new languages. I will continue to recommend it to every new person I meet!"
Duolingo is a very educational and a very useful app. It helps us learn various languages from different countries. It is very useful for school students as a hobby as well as people who think to start their career abroad.
"Duolingo is a really good app for learning languages, and it's free. It's just that there are some ads sometimes, but that's acceptable. I literally like the way this app teaches you the words, and I am learning fast!"
"Fun and SUPER easy to practice. Take 15 minutes a day to learn a language. You can definitely become proficient within a very short time. I've been learning Spanish on and off with Duolingo for a couple months, and can communicate pretty well with my co-workers who mostly speak Spanish."
"Really exceptional way to learn Portuguese. Also a lot of fun competing with others for high scores. I am already conversing with my Portuguese friends after 11 days, albeit as well as one could expect but they are very impressed."
overall the application is awesome. so far I've improved in figures of speech and pronunciation. I think that you should add a hands free mode to enable a person to study and run errands.
"It's a very good app for leaning languages but there is a big problem. The Portuguese Brazilian is not original of the Portuguese from Portugal. Hopefully there is going to be an update to change that. Very good app tho, but just that."
So I have a weird issue. =/ I went into Duolingo earlier today and noticed none of the characters were animated. Even tho I have the animation switch flicked ON. So I figured the app needed an update. I updated it and... it didn't fix anything.
Better than other such apps. Makes learning easier. But it is too slow. Should put up activities that rectify this problem and focus on the identity and individual properties of each language.
"Really great app for learning a new language. If you are using the free version it is supported by ads, however they aren't crammed down your throat constantly, shame other apps aren't as good this way! This has been for me, the best method to learn a new language!"
it is not the same Duolingo that I downloaded more than a year ago. the exercises are getting longer and longer and many of my answers have been marked wrong eventhough they are right. And it is especially annoying if after committing a mistake the exercises become HARDER THAN BEFORE!
"Really helps you to learn language fairly easily & in a fun yet challenging way. I'd recommend it as if & when you visit the country, whose language you're learning, it will be an enriched experience! & you'll learn easier."
"Honestly helps, and I feel like I have truly grown in my comprehension of the Spanish language. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this app to anyone. Infact I've recommended to people before. In short I love this app so much and I hope that this review will help you to join me, and some of my friends on Duolingo! (I realize I sound like a paid customer but trust me... I'm not, just passionate)"
"I've been learning Spanish on Duolingo on and off for a while now and I'm able to make conversations with ease. The Streaks feature really helps me stay consistent. Overall, it's a really helpful and fun app!"
"This app is easy, cool, and fun, and i learned many words|sentences. I've been relearning Russian since it's my native language, and then English. Thank you, Duolingo, for making the app excellent and easy-to-use. 5 out of 5 stars üåü ü§© ‚ú®Ô∏è."
Duolingo is very nice for learning languages. I am learning Japanese and it is helping me a lot! Thank you! The only problem is that sometimes it doesn't tell me that someone has taken my 1st position or I fell into the demotion zone or I am not in the top 5 and because of that I fell out of diamond league. It just didn't send me a notification. Please fix this.
"yall, download this! Replace some social media time with this! Its fun and rewarding to learn. If youre like me, and maybe took a language class a while ago, consider extending that knowledge! Its been great. 10/10 from me. Oh, and you don't have to pay to use it. Theres an pay version but you can go through lessons without it."
"This app is genuinely good. Encouraging, cute and the feature that you may run out of hearts actually makes you be more careful while doing the exercises. Recommend it 100% . Doesn't matter if your objective is fluency, you can still use it to improve your French. One of those apps which isn't actually cruel to its nom premium users. Just a few glitches here and there which will probably get fixed soon. Edit - it got even better. Gives you some free time of using the premium feature as a REWARD!"
"Might be considered a silly language app. However it does a superb job of getting your language skills from zero to almost hero. There is vocabulary, grammar, speaking and listening practise. I can't fault it, and it has a free tier. Kudos to the developers. I appreciate your app"
"It is extremely frustrating to be questioned on grammar (possession, gender, etc) that is not taught in the lesson, and then they removed the group discussion so no further explanation or education is offered. For a free app, it is good. For further learning, I suggest buying a textbook"
"My hearts stopped refreshing over time, so the only way to get hearts is by doing practice lessons, which gets tedious very quickly. It gives you the option to watch an ad and get a heart after the practice, but it doesn't give me the heart after I watch the add. Unless you're going to pay for it it's not worth downloading."
"honestly such a good app to learn a new language , doesn't cost any money, and if you make to many mistakes you can earn your hearts back my practicing a quick lesson. and it feels so rewarding after you finish a lesson I just keep coming back for more. so good for real."
"I love this app! I've been using it since 2017 and it never dissappoints. Also, the new home widget and the Duolingo being disappointed or happy with my streak status, it is just amazing and always makes my day! Perfect way to learn a new language in small steps, good job team!"
"I'm pretty upset that I've been getting ads for music learning and math learning for Duolingo when you guys haven't even updated it for Android yet. I'm sure something is delaying it, but it just seems biased. Apple is NOT better than Android, just like Android is NOT better than Apple. They're both equals and deserve equal privileges. I am sick of this bias, Duolingo not being the only app to do this. You guys need to get it together. I'm sick of all of it!"
"Ads (intentionally) set too loud in comparison to the lessons. I have to rush for the mute button after every lesson. Intentional(of course) so you upgrade, but this is a very slimy way to do it. Eardrums beware"
its really good! but when you finish a few levels you have to pay money to get to new levels if duolingo can get rid of it it will be nice like alot of people dont have money or credit cards
"on Duolingo I learn Spanish, I started around September/October 2023 and now speak Spanish almost fluently it's the most effective way of learning and and the easiest you can buy streak freezes on a day u can't be bothered üò¨ü§´ or are busy üòÇ. Overall this app picks up on everything you are not quite strong on and strengths it. I 100% recommend it for and think it deserves the 5 stars ps: don't look up Duolingo on TikTok üòÇüò≠"
"I think Duolingo is a very good and accessible way of introducing yourself to a new language. While playing you discover the basics, which you can use to learn the intricacies later on. I'd recommend it!"
"Best to learn a new language, having a function to increase the life by practicing only is the best, right now I am learning french, the app is teaching me better than my teacher. Their is only one request to Duolingo team please add 'Sanskrit'. And again the best language learning game like app on play store. Keep working..."
"Duolingo is a great app for learning languages, but I've noticed it lacks in explanations. I've picked up on some differences and at first I thought the app was wrong (I even reported it) only to Google it later and find out the app was correct."
"Duolingo is a wonderful app, it really encourages you to learn. And it's simply fun to use, they start by actually teaching you the basics and simple things like ordering food. I would honestly recommend this to a friend or family members"
Fun way to learn. It prompts and encourages continued learning each day. I would like more explanation of how words change by adding prefix etc and more opportunities to learn the vocab before doing the exercise.
"The voice thing is not working every time I press it it says it couldn't hear it and after a while counts it as wrong, I like doing the voice thing when you have to say the word it tells you to,Duolingos glitches are unacceptable and I ignored it for so long also I was on first place I did a lesson then it put me down to 4th place they removed 250 points and also it's unfair when people are learning English and others are learning harder languages I'll appreciate if you fixed this problem."
"I love learning different languages, especially Arabic & French. But recently I realized that it only has popular languages, it upsets me that my native isn't there. Please do add the languages Pashto, Urdu, Punjabi, Somali, Persian [ Deri/ Farsi] Tamil etc.. please do add these languages. Over all I love this app it makes learning fun and easy although I recommend you add a notepad feature so learners can note the words they learnt and look back for, reference sorry if my English is bad :)"
"Fifteen layers of challenges pop ups streaks etc for every action and can't be turned off. Default ""catch up"" exercises that are insultingly basic. And now the app icon turns into an ugly sad face? Great mission, has lost its way."
"This app is very effective for someone who would like to develop their own communication skill by practicing new language... They way Duolingo teaches us it‚Äôs very helpful for every level student like basic, intermediate or advanced.."
"Pursued a few different languages throughout my several years using it. Imho, pretty neat, I'm a beginner / intermediate but I love learning about new languages! The way it's presented is kinda fun and feels rewarding. Dopamine rushes to your brain learning new words and phrases. üëçüëç"
"The app was good, but now its going downhill like most apps. It keeps telling me I am offline when I am not and when I do find a way to start a lesson, it works for some time and goes back to saying I'm offline. I even uninstalled and reinstalled it and still the same issue, even going as far as to write an email about the issue. I have a 125 days streak and it is hell to keep it up and I am almost about to drop out of the Diamond league because I can't practice at the right time. Please fix it"
"So good for learning different languages and so fun you have a daily streak which can encourage you to do it everyday and you have two streak freezes so if you miss one or two days your streak will stay, miss three days and it will reset so make sure you work hardüëçüèªüòÅüòä I would totally recommend it to anyone who wants to learn a new language ü§ûüèªüëçüèª!GOOD LUCK!üëçüèªü§ûüèª"
"been using it off and on for years, actually getting pretty conversational in Russian! great app if you actually keep it going day by day, it doesn't feel like it at first, but slowly you really realize how quick and easy it makes it! just give it time!"
"It's been really good but lately I'm busy and can only learn occasionally.... if I don't logon for a week, every time it makes me ""review"" how to say girl, apple, man for 10-15 minutes. Such a waste of time and no way to opt out. It's enough to make me want to quit altogether."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this app, It helped me a lot. it's a wonderful app for those who are interested in learning different languages actually learning different languages is a good thing so I will surely recommend this app for those who wants to learn new languages and 'tchuss' [bye in German]."
"üòÉüèÜ This is a great (and free, so far in my experience) system to learn a new language with. It is easy to follow and has an easy to navigate user interface. I am impressed by how quickly I am learning new things with this app. I would recommend this app and way of learning to everyone!"
"Dear Duolingo team,this is what Key-Composer5478, a reddit user has said; ""This is a very bad part of the new update. Stories should be separate from the path. I only want to be conversational in Japanese. So I really enjoyed using the stories. I really do hope they go back to the stories being in a stand alone section."" I wish you would fix this and encourage us to read more. Specifically for Japanese readers. 2. Please add more indian languages like tamil.Thanking you, „Çπ„Éë„Ç≠„Éº77, A Duolingo user."
"At first, I always thought Doulingo wasn't an app that actually worked. But once I tried it out, I discovered that it does actually help you with speaking other languages. Although what they teach you are mostly just sentences and not things that actually help you."
"I DO NOT like being suddenly sprung with new words now. Before the update, we would be alerted of new words and work our way thru them. now, they ALL come in randomely. Also, the clues are now roughly 40 to 50% correct. None of these help one to learn nevertheless trying to achieve the task/challenges. I am very tempted in deleting this ap a has it has become non-user friendly. Lastly, the emoji speak wayyy too fast. There should a way to slow them down. Overall C-"
"Not impressed with how the developers promote gamifying in the app. Worse, is the attempt to monetize learning a language by forcing learning through speed matching of words. This type of exercise does not help with the development of language understanding and is the only option provided on the platform at a particular stage in the study program. It is clearly designed to try to encourage the purchase of gems to extend time limits and has no real learning value"
"The games and structure make it easy to learn and review mistakes, but it doesn't really test how much I have memorized or how easy I can recall the information. I need a conversational feature."
They keep taking features away from the app you can no longer go back and practice earlier lessons. I paid for the app and it feels like a bait and switch. should have saved my money and kept using the free version.
"Every time I get into using this app regularly, they manage to make it a little bit worse for free users. I literally watched your ads to do the match challenge rounds at 30 gems each which made you money. You got greedy and raised it to 100 so now i won't. One way or another we all pay for your app - so if you fail to treat *every* user well, it's your bottom line affected."
"a gracious free app. Helped me decide which language kept my attention and interest before committing to a subscription. Great free platform for daily practice and review with a good subscription option for additional commitment, and without their distracting ads..."
"More effective than other apps I have tried. With Duolingo, I'm speaking in sentances which I always struggled to do before using this app. It is like a human is teaching you because it alters the lesson depending on your knowledge. Amazing!"
"Mwen renmen Duolingo! (I love Duolingo!) I've been learning Haitian Creole for about 6 months now. The repetition is enough to get me remembering new vocabulary, but not enough to be boring or annoying! Duolingo is my 'go to' for new languages. Happy learning everyone!!!"
"Pretty good for learning different languages. Kinda don't like the 5 hearts system they have for lessons where you run out of them after 5 mistakes but I can understand why that system is in place, but other than that little detail I mentioned it's a fantastic app."
It is very good on the whole. There is a great variety of exercises in each unit. The odd English sentence had an incorrect structure or word usage. Some of the content was not functional enough for my needs. I would and have been recommending Duolingo to many others.
"it's great for learning other languages but I have one small complaint. You can't learn if you don't know the languages that you get to choose from at the start, so everything woud be in that language. Dualingo doesn't have language that I originally speak. So you must know at least English out of all languages that you get to choose from."
"I love duolingo, I'm learning a lot. But I'm on a stage that's easy but I have to keep quitting as it won't let me pass a certain question it freezes! I've tried 9 times now! Very frustrating. Still frozen I've now lost my 46 day streak and down on the leader board! It just doesn't work! Not happy"
"Does not teach comprehension of any language's rules. Great learning experience but it doesn't give any guidance on pronunciations leading to repeated failed attempts at saying phrases. Doesn't explain anything, randomly introduces new vocabulary without any indication of how the words are supposed to be used. Spoken a loud exercises regularly drop words and syllables and don't explain why they are dropped."
"Quite a wonderful medium of learning language, never been so excited to learn a language in other mediums and the fact that duolingo is so playful makes the experience astronomically great. I wish I started using it many years ago but at least I found it right now and I'm trying to learn, after all!"
"Really helpful, just that there is a few ads when you complete a lesson or two. Bur overall, the app is great because it's free, and you can proceed to learn another language with it!"
"Tis' is an excellent option to learn a new language. With 15-minutes lessons, you can improve in the process of adding new & better knowledge of the language. And not, this isn't generate by AI, but it's realized by myself, with what I have been learning"
Update April 2024 - this is still a buggy app. I have not been able to get the words list in my collections to work since it became a feature in Android. But there is seemingly no point in contacting Duolingo as they don't respond.
"Best Way To Learn Different Languages!! Love It So Far! Also promotes a 14 day free trail of duolingo super so it gives you 14 free days of learning as much Languages as you'd like! Simple to navigate, easy to fix your mistakes, ontop of grinding for rewards and getting the highest ranking in the leader board!"
"It's a good app. Feels like a game where you have to practice or you lose your ""streak"". Obviously, if you do miss practice and your streak resets, you don't forget where you were up to and have to go back to the beginning!"
"Rapid reviews are way too hard/fast, needs 30 more seconds on the timers. Having lots of fun learning Japanese . Simple but effective! After +1000 days of usage I'm still here! Going strong! The app has gotten much better. I'm on the free version."
"I believe that Duolingo has taking advantage of the newest discoveries in neuroscience, which is why it is so efficient. You can see that, when you are making mistakes, they have designed ways to make you remember the right answer."
"I enjoy Duolingo a lot and I think it's really helpful, I currently have a 73 day streak. but if I could change one thing i would want them to add a way to regain the streak, If you loose your streak I think you should be able to earn or buy it back, with either diamonds or do like 5 Lessons to earn it back. idk it's just scary."
"Enshitification happened. Miss the days when there weren't so many ads screens, if isn't paid it's a frustrating experience. Like everything today, enshitification means making the worse for who can't afford it, instead of making it better for who can."
"easy app. character voices can really irk, and the repetition can be mind numbing. I wouldn't mind any if that but they've made the Duo icon look depressed. doesn't make me want to log on any more."
"Very enjoyable, giving you a mini game vibe as you learn. the ads aren't invasive as you learn and pop-up between each lesson so it can be anticipated. a very good ""free-to-play"" app overall."
"The app is great but I have 2 complaints while currently learning French: it never taught me a fancy phrase for ""do you want"" & when I use the logic/syntax it HAS taught me, it tells me I'm wrong & gives me this complicated string of words that don't make sense because it was never taught. UPDATE 4/16/24 leader board is not calculating my XP correctly-it's consistently 10-30 XP lower than the ""double XP"" I should've earned (example,I only earned 120 of the 150 XP promised @ max MatchMadness lvl)"
best language learning app ever so fun üòù it's language school if it was fun! just like a game but the only thing is they teach you the most random words ever they start with words like bread and coffee and tea and bye but they don't teach you the or anyone or anything words like that and when you get a 2 day streak you don't learn like any new words.
"There are some language courses that are prioritised over other, for example the difference between dutch and german is noticible. And also I would suggest that the xp gained from each lesson increases in relation to the difficulty of the lesson and it's place in the module."
I like the fact that you can pick up and leave the sessions as you wish. The vocabulary and sentence construction leaves a lot to be desired for someone looking to learn a language to a conversational level. So many ads!
"If you persist with daily practise, the language will sink in. You ""learn"", but don't ""study"". The lack of explanation is frustrating at times, but in the end you'll intuitively understand the rules of the language, even if the path sometimes feels illogical"
"1.When you give points, gems and awards for finishing a lesson as quickly as possible it makes people race against time instead of learning anything. 2.What is the point of ""translation and writing exercise"" when you want me to just rewrite a name I can see above? 3.Why do I lose hearts for not knowing a new word when there's no way for me to check the meaning of it? 4.Why aren't there translations for words in listening exercises? Would never pay a dime for super duo. It keeps getting worse"
I want to give all stars for it. because it helps to learn language for us. And in this app we can learn different languages. I am learning English and I found that my English is improving better than ago. And this app is interesting too because we will not feel bored if we are using this. so after all this app so nice for learning languages. thank you
"I have to use this app for school, and on my friends account, she has audio lessons. I have never gotten the chance to have those lessons. I have the app fully updated, and they still don't show. Otherwise, this app is good. I'm learning French, and I have to do Spanish for school."
"Pretty good they kind of black mail you into good practice habits with the bird. Its a bit of a slow progression and can be boring, but you can skip ahead. Slow is good so you really learn it deep."
Changes the language learning courses constantly and throws me into lessons using words and phrases I've never heard before. Happens so regularly that trying to actually retain anything is even harder than normal.
This has been useful but recent update has removed accessibility feature that has made this frustrating. I am mute and cannot do speaking exercises yet am having to now every lesson say I cannot do them each time instead of it being turned off in accessibility.
"It's helpful for learning a new language, but they don't explain rules used by a language, and move too fast without these explanations. They also talk ridiculously fast, and the slow down button doesn't work."
"I like Duolingo, because it makes you use all your skills for Learning the new language , reading, writing ,two way communication, rarely you can find this qualities on one app,but what should I say ,it's Duo=Bi _dialogue & linguo= language teacher can only do it, thank you Duolingo."
"It has been a great app to use, and being a zero cost option makes it even better. It does glitch randomly, though, and that can be annoying, but it's normally once a mouth, so that's my only negative point."
"I've been doing Duoling along with my high school Spanish class, and thanks to Duo, I am the best Spanish speaker in my whole grade, maybe even in the whole school! Duolingo has really helped me with my Spanish, especially the vocabulary learning that we all hate, and I would not be getting A's in Spanish class without it. In essence, I would highly recommend using Duolingo even if you only desire to learn a language casually, but especially if you're in a Spanish class of some sort. Thanks Duo"
"Great addictively fun way to learn a new language. I only wish I could have feedback on why I got an answer wrong (I see this feature is going to be available but only for the highest subscription level, capitalism wins again huh?)"
Promotes homosexual agenda and it should not teach those morals in a language app! My children was learning a new language and if I didn't watch and listen every day I would have missed this. We got to day 68. It was in earlier lessons but I just hit the answer quick so they didn't understand it. I am so upset. Why can't you just teach the language? We will never use the app again or recommend to anyone ever again
"Duolingo is good, I wish there was a version in Castillian Spanish as a lot of the words used aren't normal for Spanish spoken in Europe. The methods are good and I actually don't mind the ads as I often have to leave my phone to do other work whilst studying!"
I think that the app is great but for some reason the voice recording translation keeps failing for me even though i said the translation correctly . And since it did not pick up what i said it keeps on telling me i got that question wrong may be its my phone or the app ?? .I know that there is a cant speak now button but its so annoying when I said the answer correctly it says i am wrong ü§îüôÑüòëü§®üòüüò°üò†üíÄüòæ
This is a great way to learn languages and its free. Unless you want to upgrade to the super plan but I would just stay to the free one. The super is pretty cool but I would stay to the free one. Hope this helps.
"This really helps learn new languages, works well. Complaints-for Chinese it doesn't teach you character writing, which is very important. Whenever you close the app it always deletes your current lesson progress, which is my biggest problem with this"
"Duolingo provides an easy approach when learning a language, so its a great way to start but I would recommend learning the language in depth without Duolingo, as this helps you master the language. Duolingo just helps get started. Overall a very good app"
Great for what it is! It cannot replace regular language classes. But its perfect to use along with them or to grow your language skills for a cross cultural trip.
"This company has become complete scum. Not only do they make users pay to remove ads, but they also expect users to pay, additional for enough ti.e to complete some courses. They intentionally do not provide enough time for some to force users to spend more. This app no longer focuses on teaching but instead milking users' wallets. Go find a better app, this one is a waste of your time and money. The popularity is from years ago when it was good."
I do recommend for anyone trying to understand a family language that you haven't picked up on or just for fun it's really easy and fun I never get bored of it. It's only my 7th day using Duolingo and I already can speak full sentences in Spanish!
"It's a great platform to learn a language, I've always wanted to learn French language; I contemplated going to the French village we have in Lagos Nigeria, but the time wasn't there. Now I'm enjoying myself learning the language at no cost at √†ll and at my pace and even in my bed! no professor of French would have had this much patience I'm enjoying with Duo, it's absolutely the best!"
"Officially the app with uncut, cut. Simple, which is the most complicated feature aussi. But what I believe I'm most impressed with is the witty banter or sass it creeps you out with preparing you for your first day of fluently being able to express yourself, able to communicate you're meaning mi any and everything, I want and wanted Ic. Might do more, yet I'm alright with it's doing and wonder what it's not for me. I almost believe it's all about me"
The app said they will tell you 2 days before your free trial ends but instead you receive no notice or noth8ng and they charge you!!! Super scam with no customer service. Very bad. Just paid an year subscription with no reason! Guys choose something else!
"Please! For the love of God, change the depressing old man face that you gave the owl. The recent updates to the app have been great. I love that you provide explanations for some of the grammar now and you added the vocabulary review game. But please change the icon back to the cute owl. I'm about to delete the app just because I can't stand to look at the app. It brings me down every time I look at it. I know I'm not alone on this. Many people on reddit have already claimed to have uninstalled"
"I am uninstalling today, after completing my 1000 day streak for Yiddish (in honor of my great-grandmother, who worked much of her later years to preserve the language) due to the reliance on rote memorization over learning; the internal switch to AI over human language experts and employees; the desperate monetization tactics; and their lack of support for some of the more endangered languages it used to offer and took pride in. I have used Duo off and on for years, but it's time to go."
It is a fun way to learn a language. The gamification is effective. There is always a portion where you get tired of the repetition but I know I need to get through those for the words to solidify.
"My first and longest streak was 409 days. I'm not sure if I can beat it, but I'm going to try. I love the premium perks and I really love seeing how far the app has come and how much it has changed. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to feel like they're playing a game while they're actually learning. it is very easy to use."
"as far as I have it I say that yes, learning new languages the school way is more than ever boring,but this app makes it a lot of fun, because just like video games, you have quests to complete, treasures to open and the best part is that during all this it feeds you the veggies without showing them,that ways u learn in fun, and the leader board ofc, that is what keeps me committed. Good job Duolingo."
so far love Duolingo. It's so fun like a game while still the words are repeated so you can learn more and you barely get as much ads then you'd expect l. All in all I recommend this app for anyone who is a total beginner and wants to learn a new language.
Too many random words that will rarely be used in everyday sentences as a beginner. 'The pink vase'? It's good for getting an idea of the language but this should only supplement more interactive/formal real life lessons.
"Really loved this app, the upgrade took a while to get used to, but it's still the best language app out there. Seem to be having problems registering some in my xp progress, a problem noted by other users."
"sometimes when i complete my lessons, the progress does not get counted. i need to reatart the app or do an alphabet lesson just for it to load. it's very irritating how I can't go through the lessons smoothly although i still have hearts."
"I prefer the regular Duolingo and not the super Duolingo because I like the practice of earning stars. I don't like it when they give me the trial, without being able to switch back to the regular Duolingo. Enjoy the lessons though."
"Greediness has ruined this app. I swear to God that I could do the Lightning Round freely with no cost before the recent update, but now it costs some gems to do that. That undoubtedly turns the League into a PAY-TO-WIN game which is the 1# killjoy in most competitive games. The majority of helpful features that's LOCKED behind a paid subscription doesn't help either. Surely this is a huge L for Duolingo. Still good for casual practices though, just not too beginner friendly."
I spend more time listening to the insistent Super Duolindo advertising than doing the lessons. I will stop using it soon if this doesn't change. The app is going overboard at this point and is becoming unbearable.
"one improvement I would suggest, add modules where Doulingo states a phrase and the user answers, such as in a conversation. otherwise, a great tool for learning the language in a fun, competitive way."
Hey it's a great app i will give it to them the only problem is the hearts ‚ù§Ô∏è once you loose them it is gone no more studying üòû but I learnt a lot of French from this app and I am still learning I am excited to continue learning French üòÜ so. everyone with the intention of learning a new language (any language) download duolingo thumbs up from meee üëçüëçüëçü•∞. PS: I will probably be back with another review soon. byeee
Still can't do any of the speech related excersises. It just switches off as soon as you open your mouth and says that doesn't sound right when you haven't even been able to speak in the first place. I do however like the way it teaches you a language only wish I could choose mother tounge rather than learning from a second language...
Great app and very engaging. I think there should be a section for messages so that you can chat with your friends and people you follow. It would be easy to help people keep up on duolingo and remind them to keep practicing their languages. Or we could just make small talk.
"BEWARE OF SCAM: Duo is offering a ""60% discount"" for new years, by first increasing the price by 110%!! App gets worse with every update. Every day I disable speaking lessons and the next day it's reset the settings. The app also treats language learning more like a profitable video game rather than actually learning. And they added hearts to PC version so can't just learn for hours on end without paying. Scam."
"THIS APP IS AWESOME,I have learned so much French in just 9 days compared to the vids in YouTube! For me, EVERYBODY should give this a 5 star rating because you can learn so much from Duolingo and maybe I could get up to unit 2 before my birthday comes on June! I also love the fact that they give you 5 hearts everyday and if you don't have Super Doulingo like me you could just learn more by practicing for them! And for those who don't have Doulingo you shall download it right now, CUZ ITS GREAT!"
"Super fun to learn. Since it's gamified, you get that dopamine which helps you with consistency to some extent. I already know English, certainly not a pro but neither a beginner. I can't wait to try it with Japanese."
"well the app is designed (for the none payer) so that making one too many mistakes locks you away from trying to learn. When learning is blocked, more mistakes are bound to happen, and so on you spiral down and unlearn the things ypu're trying to imprint."
"Duolingo is the language learning app , to be!!!! Minus ads , I love Duolingo so much, but can people who already have Duolingo become my friend?Add this , and I'll love Duolingo X10 the amount that I love Duolingo now !!!!! Well, it just gave me a notification that said ""you missed your Spanish lesson, you have 5 seconds to open me "". Yet I am not learning Spanish. I'm learning Japanese!!!!!"
"This app is useful. I like this. But, why the icon having a sad face sometime? It's annoying actually. It's just... I don't wanna see that icon. I kept Duolingo in my homepage first, but because of this sad and tired icon, I removed it from homepage. It's not nice..., At sometimes, I even thought of uninstalling the app just because of this sad face... But I didn't, because this app is great and also I'm maintaining streaks daily...How to change that icon? I really wanna know. I didn't like it."
"wow, this is so nice. the people who stay at home they can easily learn new new languages for their enjoyment. and even if some people go to different places but they do not know the language of that particular place then they can use this particular app unlock that state's language. keep it up Duolingo team."
"This app makes me feel alive again, I find my life meaningless at times but learning a new language feels like a fresh new start sometimes.. thank you Duolingo... I will say though... they got rid of the forums and I couldn't figure out the Discord ones... I miss those. I used to learn so much more."
"The way it teaches you slowly piece by piece in bite size lessons is perfect. Also has stories, leagues, reminders, personalised practice hub, Text to speech, and it covers all areas of a language."
"I am taking off 2 entire stars because I am so incredibly sick of every aspect of the reminder system being emotional blackmail. Showing the widget angry or suffering, emails and notifications from characters trying to make me feel bad in order to play, dude stop it! There are better ways to motivate people!!! This complaint is all over the Internet too ffs"
"It's a decent app for learning the basics of a foreign language, however there are a lot of grammatical issues and mistranslations that makes absolutely no sense, I was just testing my native language and apparently I don't know my own language according to duolingo."
"It's good to learn but , I can't understand the language only I can understand the small words by this I can write the words but let us see what will happen after. Please I want to learn whole Korean language. But any how this app is good for children by playing games they can learn something, it's really interesting app I loved this app. Thank you DUOLINGO..............."
"honestly, a very helpful app to learn languages. only issue I had so far was going through the UI but and there being ads at the end of every lession. other then that it's great!"
I have an issue... I am going to summer camp for a full five days and you only get two streak freezes... I don't wanna loose my streak.. Uhm this is horrible and I would like to be able to have like five to ten streak freezes. Oh and when I have no hearts but duo is pressuring me to keep my streak.. I CAN'T... I HAVE NO HEARTS.... But other than that great app. Would recommend if you aren't picky like me üòÇüòÇ
I am using Duolingo to learn Japanese now. It is fun with learning. and the concept of different leagues keeps you motivated. Levels are created very thoughtfully it seems. App didn't crash for once. It runs smooth.
SUUUPPPERRR GOOD I luv it sooooooo much it's perfect there's just one thing I would like to change.. plz make like 5 missions per day cuz I'm getting nowhere the missions really give u something to think about to encourage u to learn and the leaderboard is also encouraging so off that it's perfect
It's the best app I've seen for learning any language. The app seems to have issues connecting to the internet since the recent updates. It has become stressful to complete lessons. Something needs to be done about it soon. Please
"It's a good app which helps children elders etc to learn many different languages for future use . My little child learnt French, German and Russian in 5 or 6 months . now she can speak these three languages very very well. It's just like a game ."
"Really fun and helpful app, except my Duolingo app widget image seems to have done some psychedelic drug cause its face is distorted. Now it looks really tired, and the face is sagging. Change the icon back to happy and normal expression, please and thank you."
I gave Dolingo a 10 out of 10 because it like really teaches you in fun ways how to do it and it's very strict but not strict and that's the way I love it and I have one question why is Duolingo on my page it's starting to get like wrinkly and old but it really helps you I know a lot of Portuguese now and I'm starting to learn Russian and it's like really good because when you start it gives you like a couple of things on one app to learn and I have two Portuguese in Russian and it gives you Xfi
"The old version would really prepare for the exames. This version feels like a speed run, doesnt prepare you for the exames. Probably not going to pay next year subscription, its really just annoying."
Duolingo is a 10 on 10 . It's a perfect example of excellence for all language learners . I love this app a lot and i have learned many languages with this app without having super premium. Wonderful experience for me . Everyone should try this app .
"I love to learn with Duolingo. It is a very clever app, but I think that brittish english should be accepted also. I used to have problems with mistakes only because I know brittish english (living in the UK) and not everything from american english, so I lost so many lives just because of that. I am Czech, and english is my second language. I am learning spanish with Duo and I can't learn it from the czech language which I don't mind, because I also improve my english. Overall, I am enjoying ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I really like duolingo, I learn 3 languages (Spanish, French and German) And it's literally splendid! I love the tip thing and I'm still a school student and we learn French so I'm Learning French for school, knowledge and fun! Thanks creators for making this amazing app!üíö Edit: I'm learning Japanese now, as I almost finished Spanish and German, even though people say Japanese is hard, I like how you learn literally EVERYTHING! Duolingo is an app that everyone needs, either for fun or knowledge"
"Update: they charged my credit card a renewal but didn't credit the app. I have contacted their support email several times with absolutely no response. I sent a copy of the credit card payment again, crickets . The app was better in the beginning. Now it looks like it's written by 12-year-olds. Very woke, many many ads."
"No Thais, Tamil and others Asian Languages. Feel really sad I download this apps in hopes there will be a Asian Language inside the app. Oh, when using Bluetooth headset, the oral test that need we speak louder always end very fast. Should allow appropriate time since when the app detect no sound or wrong vocal sound, its will deduct our hearts. Please improve on this and add asian languages. I reduced the review star again."
"the leagues are absolutely frustrating. yesterday I was first, today I need 600 xp just to progress to the next level. dies not focus on the areas i struggle with enough, instead it beats in stupid stuff like a green house instead of verb congigation and gender of items like bread"
"Soo.. I bought the Premium / super thing, and now- The app is not opening. I've googled ways to open it, and it kept saying ""Check if it needs an update"" I did, and it didn't need an update. Now I'm REALLY confused. So, can I have some help please?? But other than this issue, the app is absolutely AMAZING! Deutsch ist jetzt noch mehr Spa√ü! ü•≥"
"I really like that you can learn multiple languages at the same time, even if you haven't got premium. But sometimes I wish that they would explain the grammar or the reason for a specific ending for example."
"It's a amazing app to learn different learn different languages, of course activating SUPER DUOLINGO makes us learn way faster , You can do more than 1 language and the lessons are for how much you know already!!! Well it's a amazing chance to learn a new mother tongue ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Duolingo is a good language learning app as it starts of easy and amps up in difficulty, but the thing that is keeping it down from five stars is that now I can't do my lesson as it freezes when I start a lesson, even though my internet is perfectly fine."
"An amazing app for starters. Learning fun, interesting words and enough grammar(for me as a starter). Even free this app works really well. I would recommend it for everybody that wants to learn by also speaking with he app and playing learning games!"
"Wonderful. I have learnt so much in a short time. I am trying to learn Spanish and have been doing fine, until now!! I am trying to answer a question but the lesson won't let me enter all the letters to the question, all I get is wrong answer and I can't move on to the next question. So, I am going to lose my 610 day streak!!! I am a subscribed customer!! Fix this problem NOW so I can continue my level and keep my streak!!!"
"Good application if you are ready for the in app payment, even if you are Willing to tolerate the adds they only provide 5 chances per day until you are locked out. if you looking forward to a learning new language U better have a nice insight into the language you are going to learn. As a new guy to German then app is expecting me to know the language beforehand even if am a newbie. As i said it's a good application if you are serious about the dedication with a hint of money to spare."
"Released music and math on iOS several months ago, but still nothing on android or web. Really sad to see such a large discrepancy in how Duo prioritizes various user bases. Cost of subscription is not adjusted to reflect lower content quality on Android OS."
"Duolingo is indeed an incredible language learning app with its user-friendly interface and gamified approach. Adding Afrikaans would be a fantastic expansion, broadening its reach to learners interested in mastering this unique language. Here's hoping they heed the call for Afrikaans soon!"
"Ok first off... Im on a 20 day streak rn and I did a lesson today to get my 21 day streak but, Duolingo is still telling me to practice even though I already practiced for the day. Please fix this issue Bc I don't want to restart with a 1 day streak I worked hard everyday to get in first place so I really practice for an hour a day. I have a bunch of xp so please just fix this issue. Thanks. -FnafFan"
"this is a good app for learning languages better than other apps also but it has some issues like it doesn't work when it's Life finished and waited for 4 hours just for one life. If the wait of life becomes less hours, it should be very good for learners also and if possible it can work while offline also üòÅ."
"it's a really good app and it takes you step by step till you properly understand, most important, it's both fun and free. (unless you want the premium) also Duolingo is so patient with you and doesn't rush you and bother you to do a lesson.10/10 DEFINITELY recommend üëç"
"Duolingo is such a game changer. There's something about this app, it just proportions the steps to make it so easy. Before I knew it I was saying full sentences. Im currently learning Spanish. I always wanted to learn how to speak it since I was a little kid. My whole family speaks it I can kind of catch on, but really. Me and my cousins would speak gibberish and act like we are having an engaging conversation, because we wanted to know how to speak Spanish so bad. Now I can have real convos."
"Aggressive ads for inappropriate topics, Poor support after the initial few classes and overall an expensive option compared to the others. It's been overly gamified to create/force reasons to spend money which disrupts users learning. Wouldn't recommend."
"this is so great! I have a friend who speaks Chinese, so she is guiding me alongside duolingo. this is so perfect for beginners who want to support their friends and family. I'm so excited to see duolingo math and music. thank you for creating this app!"
This app is great it brings old lessons so you won't forget but other than that I want to learn Thailand but I couldn't find one or I'm just being blind... but yes the app is great but I rated it two because I couldn't find Thai Language... I just wish you can add Thai language that's all thanks...
"I love Duolingo. I have used it in the past to learn Norwegian and am now learning Spanish. The app is even better than it used to be. I am a pro user, and it is worth every penny I have paid. The lessons and structure are fun and very effective time-wise! I definitely recommend it. üëå"
it is fun and serious at the same time. the characters are very encouraging with the tap to speak feature being indispensable. I often doubt that I'm actually saying something correctly. with the tap to speak feature my nerves are calmed ü•∞
I've only been using it for two weeks and I love it! I'm learning Chinese and the way you learn it on duolingo is very easy and beginner friendly. The lessons aren't super complicated either!
it's an amazing app to learn a language and keep your brain busy but the problem is that there is a limited amount of hearts and then u have to wait a long time. other than an that it's a very good app. very nice
"fun way of learning at one's own speed. only looses a star because the speaking exercises stopped working some time ago, despite changing it in settings and saving changes."
App is great for learning if you pay for it. Makes you feel like an idiot for getting wrong. Happens even though you enter what you were taught by Duolingo as an answer. Would give 0 stars if I could. Has heavily discouraged my desire to learn new languages through this app
"The interface is very good and simple , the teaching methods r very good . Only thing I dislike that there is add afer every lesson and also the number of lives should be increased."
"Paying subscriber who has been using Duolingo every day for the past 330 days - the quality of the lessons suddenly incredibly decreased after Duo switched to AI generated lessons - the sentences are nonsensical (not in a joke way), there were grammatical errors too, really don't enjoy torturing myself trying to make sense of it to pass through my lesson, I won't be renewing my subscriptions unless Duo hires real people again, even if the quality went back up it's immoral to support this anyway"
"It would be nice to be able to opt out of leagues without disabling other social functions. Learning on Duolingo and playing Duolingo to win leagues feel like two different things , but the app pressures you to do both."
"Great app, lots of fun and useful, but IT KEEPS CRASHING! Often, after I finish a level, I get the wheel of death and it locks up! I have to play the same level over again."
"It is the perfect app for learning a new language! I am doing it for 1,6 years But it was not cool of raising the amount of jems for the weekly dashboard again! It was 10, then 30 and now 50! Not cool at all!"
I love this app! Although it had too many ads unlike Duolingo ABC has no ads but I love it so much! And also even there is a few problems every question that I almost accidentally pressed the report button that's literally okay! Thank you Duo ^-^
This app has shown the basics of speaking a language. I feel better when I understand something in a different language. Of course if you pay it gives you more and perks. The basic is pretty good by itself
"I'm learning japanese right now, and I'm using duolingo as a companion. it's very helpful for learning words; the only thing I would recommend to new learners is to use duolingo ALONG WITH a book or something else. otherwise great app!"
Duolingo is a wonderful language learning app but the new updated style is just not as good as the previous one. Also the avatars are quite boring and i would prefer to have the option of having either an avatar or a profile picture.
"Nice app, but weird behaviour. It works fine 3-4 days and suddenly it doesn't open. Tried several times, several days. Must reinstall it and it works. After 2-3 weeks again. Once it fixed it by making update but then again. Same problem."
what can I say it is the best to learn how to pronounce it write it and even to speak it it helped me a lot and I am even planning to learn 6 more language and it is possible thanks to Duolingo as well I'll preferred if it could have exams each week and get a reward of 500 diamond it be great. all an all it is Amazing best experience it doesn't frustrate me and reminds me and a positive manner I will agree üíØ it is the best. if it could have the creole language it be even more better come to duo
Good app but you cant review earlier material without creating a profile. why should you have to create a profile. poor choice. choose another app that you dont have so sign up for. Lowered to 1 star. All of the beginner first words section is gone. Starts with sentences before you even learn the individual words. Very poor (Mandarin)
"love it, the daily reminders make sure I do my lessons and the premium is definitely worth it, but even if you can't afford premium the ads aren't even that bad of an issue, plus you might get lucky and unlock a free period of premium"
It's good I learned a Lot from it the only thing though is if u don't practice in a while duo will keep on sending you notifications to practice and that is annoying and the app will have a sad bird and i had a 54 day streak and i didn't practice for 1 day and it reset the streak but other than that it's a great app OH and did I forget to mention that it will let u try again on the stuff that you miss you should definitely download it and plz fix that stuff that I said plz thanks
I love love Duolingo it's a fantastic awesome groovy learning of different languages and any language in the world m way way better than babble. and it's free to learn. and you're learning real authentic languages from other countries. I'm loving German. sense I'm part German myself m I highly recommend to anyone. download Duolingo free on the play store. thanks and I've learned new words and hard sentences so far o German. love love it. will stick to it and stay committed m
"it's actually fun, the learning and stuff is cool. but what scares me are the widgets. when it's that ""time's almost up!"" widget, the image that pops up sometimes scares me. overall, nice app y'all got. (I CANT WITH THE CHANNEL THOUGH-)"
"Is good but a problem that i found is, I choose to use Japanese, no romanization but whenever I started the lesson, it'd change into romanization. And sometimes the sound aren't so clear, like 5% of the time only but still a problem."
"Because no grammatical information is given, and you have to figure it out, or guess, doing just 20 minutes is exhausting. After I finish this Duolingo course I'm going to have to do a real course to learn all of the things that I was forced to just guess here. To give you a context, I speak several languages already, have studied in University how to teach second languages, and have spent about 7 years of my life teaching second languages."
I think that duolingo is the best language learning app that helps everyone while learning new languages that we have no idea of. It has an unique way of learning. Love the concept. Thankyou so much to the makers of Duolingo ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Duo is a great app and I am definitely not held on gun point. but seriously I enjoy the app as it is fun but the problem is that it teaches me words without telling me the meaning and it also doesn't have enough languages to Arabic learners as she doesn't speak English and wanted to learn Italian but it was not on the Arabic learners' list
"good for extending your vocabulary and learning certain phrases, but does not give a full explaination on grammar and some courses are less developed than others. overall i would recommend."
"I wish the Duolingo team could make projects for learning local language of India for eg they should make Learning lessons for Bengali, Assamese, Tamil, Telgu, and so on. Because a lot of people move to other states for job or educational purpose, they will get benefits of Duolingo as The system on Duolingo is the best ever I have been to.."
"This learning app is great but it has the hearts that make it waaaaay more annoying than it should be because every time I make a mistake I shouldnt have to do more lessons or wait 4 hours to get 1 more chance to do it. And they need to fix the fact that if you learn any language with foreign symbols like japanese, than you cant type them in the typing box, so I can only use the word part options instead of the typing, which I think would be more cool. Please fix these duolingo."
"I started back in november and found that, although not perfect, i was learning. The main issue why i stopped is because I was loosing lives over small mistakes or simply by showing me new words that ive never seen. After 5 lives you had to wait 4 hours to get 1 back, forcing you to either be very slow on your progress or quitting. But now, you can do small revisions and gain 1-2 lifes back watching an add. Great stuff, i love this implementation. Makes it much more rewarding"
"Listen, I like duolingo. I do. But I'm literally uninstalling because of the creepy, off-putting, owl icon. I don't want to look at it anymore and I especially don't want to get baited into opening this app by an icon change I have no control over."
"I've been having a problem with app for about a 2 weeks. Even though I passed the lesson, the next day shows that I did not pass and that the freeze protected my streak!! Please, fix that!!!!"
"I do really like duolingo and think it is a great way to learn a language..however I feel it is missing very important indigenous languages such as Yurok, the other indigenous language, Navajo is the only native language on duolingo and I think it's great that it is on there but what about other's? Aren't we also important? So many indigenous languages are lost and I believe duolingo could really help turn that around if they work with more tribes."
"Terrible! The app has become unusable now. It keeps rolling back to a previous state undoing all the lessons I've done. I've lost count of the number of times I've attained legendary status on the same lesson only to find myself back at square one. As it's not letting me progress any farther, I guess I'll have to continue my polyglot journey on some other platform. Should've known when they started removing useful stuff like discussion forums while introducing useless UI changes & nag screens."
this is the best app that I have ever seen to learn a language very easily within a month. in this app we can learn any two languages at a time . it is based on our interest. anyways I'm learning Japanese .i tried many other apps to learn that language but none got me like this app .. in my opinion this is the best app .
"I love this, have been studying on this for 6 years!! It's somewhat fun, especially that I have super duolingo. Anyways, I really recommend this! You even have adorable widgets that appear on your home screen if you allow it! 9.5/10!"
"Amazing way to boost your learning. It is great whether you are a beginner or already know some stuff. They have embraced the memes too which I love. Duolingo cares for its community! However there are two minor issues. 1: especially in Ukrainian, the words they teach you at first aren't so useful. 2: Super learners can earn an hour's worth of xp in 2 minutes, making leaderboards difficult to get first. I understand that it's the way they make money but realistically, nobody can afford it!"
"Please add an option to switch off the very loud sound in the end of each task, it is too loud In listening task there is no sound at all, very often (but the loud sound of checking the task is always working!)"
"I love duolingo because it helps me learn new and different languages. It helps with speaking, writing, texting, hearing, and things like that,Just to get you used to your new language, you want to learn.Duolingo actually helps me learn my Spanish and I am improving soo much thank you Duolingo!!"
"Thank you for such a good free app! Please, add confirmation to turn off pronunciation and listening tasks in the lessons. I often accidentally touch this button. This is annoying."
Great for revising if you had previously learnt a language. It should have a way to teach you the words before being quizzed. Maybe there is a way and I may have missed it.
"highly recommend Duolingo, it is so easy to use and makes it fun to learn another language, you can choose the pace that is best for you. Thanks Duolingo for such a great easy way to learn a different language. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
"I'm not here to compete!!! Learning a language is a long process. It takes time and lots of practice. By making this a competition, you make people forget why they are here, and when they finally realise that they didn't learn sheit, they give up and leave negative reviews. And why does the logo character look 70+ years old? Change it back because it looks dumb af."
"this is such a great language program! it's so simple, the lessons are short, you learn contextually the way you learned your native language without having to belabor grammatical rules. Duolingo makes learning fun and I am really enjoying it!"
"I enjoy the app, and lessons are a good mix of fun and challenging, but frustrated that I use the paid version while Android users don't seem to have access to Music/Math at this time. Also have issues with 30-min XP boosts from friend quests disappearing when I select them, rather than actually giving me a timed boost."
"Really good and addictive to play, the use of competitive leaderboards keeps me playing to get lots of xp, in turn, I do more lessons and I learn the language better as I continue. Good app, also if you're wondering, I'm learning arabic. ÿ¨ŸäÿØ."
This is the best language Learning game that I had ever seen in my life . It was amazing and if you are learning Japanese or Korean here I swear you will learn that language soo fast . It took me about 2 days to learn basic words. I didn't even realise like I'm studying it was like a game which I was enjoying. You should really give it a try.
"The courses are decent, but the incessant ads for their premium version are really annoying, and every time I am forced to watch them I feel less inclined to pay for it."
"Very nice app, fun and efficient. Only problem is active the try of the super mode without our permission and no way to deactivate for a long 14 days... It's really uncomfortable."
"There is a way for them to turn off auto correct when showing you the keyboard. They need to set the input type on the edit text fields were typing into and turn off suggestions, so when we type spanish words it's not correcting them to unrelated English words. Developers: Edittext.setinputype(Inputtype.type_class_text | Inputtype.Type_text_flag_no_suggestions) Get that going please! I hate auto correct in this app!"
"I'm surprised how much I've learned, lessons are short but nice and repetitive through the units so you can really get it to stick, learning a new language as an adult is daunting but duolingo really helps keep it manageable"
"So sick that I'm paying the same amount for Super on Android as iOS. Duolingo Android doesn't get the Maths, Music, nor AI features that iOS users do. It's also stupid that Duolingo decided to branch off into non-language features instead of focusing on their main purpose. Their CEO made such a stupid decision to redirect funds to non-language features."
"starting out with basics like the alphabet might make this better. I'm over 90 days, and it's starting to act like I'm pretty fluent in the language I'm doing. I can read what the lesson says, but I can't start a conversation. I'd probably be failing if the answers weren't pretty obvious in the multiple choice sections."
Fun to learn and very good app but recently I am having problems. My conversation is not recognised by the app in my Android phone. I have given mic permission and my phone mic also works perfectly. The conversation is recognised in my iphone. Please do the needful
"The new Duolingo icon shows a bird smoking cigarette. My kid uses Duolingo, i am afraid that he will be influenced in a wrong way. Edit: Please change the Duolingo icon and make him happy like the way he was before. I cannot see Duolingo being depressed. I even changed my rating from 1 star to 5 stars since you removed the smoking icon. Now come out of the pit of depression that smoking put duo in."
"I've been using Duolingo for roughly a year now to learn German. It's a great app. It's courses can help beginners, advanced and anything in between! It has many languages to choose from. But, it can buffer and have a lot of lag. Overall, it is an amazing app for anyone to enjoy!"
I think that this helps a lot because when I was at library my teacher asked are you still reading this 1000 words in German book I said yes and said it takes awhile to learn German and then the teacher said well try Doualingo my son is using it so I tried it for 2 days and now this is a lot more easier to use then a big old book. When then says it's like a game they mean it I love learning now üòÇüòÄü•≥üòÉ
"I really like the app. But the advertisements break it. And I have to spend 5 minutes opening, closing and reopening the app to continue. Fix the advertisements."
I have kept up my French in Duolingo since highschool and I wish there were options to listen to French versions of my favorite songs on Duolingo. My French teacher used to use French music to help us learn and it genuinely helped but I'm not in highschool anymore obviously
It was OK for basics but it starts setting you up to lose hearts on purpose I believe. Expecting you to give answers for things you've never been shown before. I suspect this is to try to get you to subscribe so you can't run out of hearts. That's pretty underhanded.
"This app is super helpful and it's da best! I love now I know how to talk English and type! If u don't like this app their is smth wrong wit you!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't have that much time but I still learn a lot, I don't have time bcuz I have homework and school! But I only used this app a little and now I'm an expert!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you so much srry Duolingo I haven't been able to get on this app but it's da best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I really love this app so much, it's great and I can learn!!!!"
"It is a solid way to learn a language. It is probably the most well-known way, at least. I will say, though, that the life system can be quite frustrating at times, only remedied by the ""Practice to earn hearts"" option."
It is a very good app for learning. I learn Turkish and I learned a lot from Duolingo but the thing is that I want super Duolingo to be free with no money and it's hard to afford super Duolingo so please let super Duolingo for free and I remember that Duolingo said that you can learn math and anthor thing but I can't find it so please tell us where can we get it because I want to know more on math and see how math in Duolingo
"Thank you so much for all that you do and are doing. It's a very innovative app. Whilst it is helpful on all levels, I'd like it if the app icon is changed, it's giving off a depressing vibe, pls make it more cheerful. Thank you and well done!"
"There should be a review/practice for the mistakes that cause you to lose hearts. Instead you do easy practice on old lessons, then lose hearts again with current lessons. Very frustrating!"
"Superb app, very user friendly, kids and adults can use this app with ease. Kudos to the team on incorporating the gamification to make using the app very fun but at the same time imparting valuable skills. thank you team."
I love having free lessons and short ones at that. sometimes I feel they could give you the option for a lengthen or more in depth lesson. But what I really am bothered by is when I get so.ething wrong... I'm not told why. No explanation. and I havnt seen an explanation as to when where & why to use the letter marks- such as √® or √±.
Loved it in the past and still find it useful but I'm over the ridiculous notifications and my sisters have both quit using the app because of it. People are calling the notifications passive aggressive but I find them outright abusive and off-putting. Lift your game Duo.
"There is a bug, my xp keeps getting reduced day by day and I keep falling to demotion zone even when I have earned more XP than the people in demotion zone. One moment it says I have 130xp and after completing another lesson rather than the XP increasing it shows I have 84xp in total, and I would be in demotion zone"
well I wish it had more interaction when it comes on to learning items from new languages the apps A.I pronounces it for you and you would have to use memory to try and remember the names. I was seeking more of a step by step procedure when it comes on to pronunciation and enunciation.
Generaly motivating to keep learning the language but using ai or whatever for the speech listening exercises is really disturbung. Feels like its not saying a sentence but just saying each word individually. So you don't get the speech flow of the language.
It's actually been very helpful learning basic Spanish for my new job considering it's free. It's also something that a majority of the spanish-speaking co-workers I have use to learn English So we can kind of stay on the same pace if you will and keep each other practicing outside of the app
"was going great for a while but after about 120 days in, my courses were altered and I was hit with a bunch of words I didn't actually learn. i don't see why y'all can't update the courses AND offer a means to catch up on new material in ""finished"" courses. put a huge rut in my momentum. also boo ai , will not be resubscribing. add: I like the words practice , except where it uses 80% of the same words from day to day. I have almost 600 words learned but every day is pilipala, gafr, r≈µan etcüôÑ"
I am overall satisfied with this app. It's a really useful and great app for any foreign language learners. But there is one thing that I don't like. Why has the app image changed so strangely? I really hate this so that I don't really want to go into that app. Please change the app image. This is the only one thing that I want from this app.
"I really love the app! even without Super Duolingo, the ads are short and the amount of information you gain is precious and valuable. Thank you very much for creating this app! really, teally useful!ü•∞ Too bad I only heard about it few days ago, wish I had learnt faster."
"Learning has never been this fun! I am learning Japanese language through Duolingo for past 15 days and it has been an awesome experience for me. I have not gotten bored or overwhelmed. However, at some places things can get repetitive but can be used for revision. I only urge the people at Duolingo to (ku da sai) add more Indian languages apart from ""Hindi"" which is already present. I wanted to learn ""Telugu"" my native language, but couldn't find one."
This is a very great app. At first I didn't know that how I can learn French easily but when I started learning it from Duolingo it made French easy to understand. I recommend you to install this app and learn a new language. Gain some knowledge about other languages also. That was all. Merci beaucoup. (Thank you very much)
"I'm using this to sharpen my French (turns out I remember most of it), and to one day learn a new language or two. The lessons are superb, organized and engaging. I strongly recommend this app!"
"There is a glitch that prevents me from completing the speaking exercises, which is frustrating. Other than that, the app is great for picking up a language as quickly as possible"
"Great app, one feature request please add dragging words among others. Otherwise if one of the word is missed the whole sentence needs to be cleared and all words need to be dragged again from beginning."
"It's great, but unfortunately one doing one of the lessons it kept stuck, hanging, and the Continue button was unable to display. This made me lose my progress."
"It's a great supplement to my Pimsleur program since it feels like I'm taking a game break. added bonus, that I'm hearing the target language more and I get to compete. The competition and the streaks keep me coming back!"
"When you have your volume turned down and click can't listen now, the very next question requires you to turn up your volume. And there's no way to skip. If I wanted to have the sound on, I'd have left it on."
"This app is very great. because is app very helpful all the peoples. It is my experience . My english is very poor. One day I am install this app. Afterthat my english is improve. I will suggest please install this app. and hardworking, patience, discipline, very must. because english is not difficult but practice regular your english will be improve. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Best app / program EVER! This is the only app I pay for - but the free version is just as awesome (The paid version is even BETTER)! I'm turning into a language learning BEAST! :Update: I LOVE duo's new threatening and withering widget icons. Soooo funny, and it makes me study more."
"Surprisingly consistient, all these years later. One thing that sucks is the removal of community feedback on each question, giving more insights on how words work with each other outside of the exercises. It took away the sense that you were learning alongside others :("
Excellent!!! Quite interesting & simple user interface especially for kids & teenagers as learning something has always been boring for them but Duolingo makes exciting for them. Learners of any age or class will find it easy.
"Duolingo is on the whole a great app. I am deeply concerned with the recent change to monetize gems, and consequently to then charge money for higher XP rounds (Note: in premium, where I already pay a subscription). An app that is designed for kids has now become yet another in-app purchase monster. You should immediately fire the money-grubbing execs who though this was a good idea."
"For a gamified learning app, I've been disappointed to find inaccuracies in calculation of scores and ""daily quests"" completed. I submitted a bug notification and received a canned response saying not to expect my issue to be addressed directly and asking me to upload screenshots anyway. The lessons are fair for increasing comprehension, but I'm not planning to renew my subscription."
Learning so much Spanish with this. And it's free. I love the repetition of words I've had trouble with in the past or phrases because I can qualify how much I'm learning as I push through the lessons.
"I just started learning Japanese using Duolingo. Before I started, I already know a lil bit of its grammar and most of it characters and how to write then. I just noticed that the pronunciation of some characters are incorrect and the some english grammars are weird. This app must also accept other answers cuz I end up with a wrong answer even if my answer is the same from the correct answer but just in a different arrangement of words. Some pronunciation just really bothers as they're incorrec"
"It's still terrible & getting worse. Watch ads to get gems every hour, didn't work yesterday. Get points & 2xp for daily goals, nope. Pay 2,000 gems to freeze your league streak, pay & they don't restore your 61 weeks. The game aspect keeps one from advancing one's learning bc staying on top is the ultimate goal as opposed to just learning. They also don't respond to email."
"I keep trying to use Duolingo []. There's no explanation anywhere of course structure and no way of contacting Duolingo. I don't even know what sort of Arabic they claim to teach. I've posted before but never get an answer. Months later: so fed up with Duolingo I'm on brink of uninstalling. NO grammar explanations, not even a vocab list so it's often a case of guesswork to get exercises right. And today after a loooong session I ended up losing ALL the XP I had gained for no obvious reason.üëéüôÑ"
"Duolingo has been an incredibly useful tool in my language learning journey. The variety of languages offered and the gamified learning approach make it enjoyable to practice regularly. The lessons are well-structured and gradually build on each other, helping me to grasp new concepts effectively. The community aspect adds a fun competitive edge, and the option to practice speaking and listening skills is a great addition."
"It would've been fantastic!! But the lessons started out right away with sentences and not with alphabet or even simple words. I did eventually find an alphabet section where you could hear the sounds of the letters and there might've been alphabet lessons. But I'm not even sure if those lessons are counted toward the goal. I did Hebrew, but mom said Spanish is the same way. Maybe an app tutorial is needed in the user's native language before lessons start."
"Good app to learn the basics. Using it to learn Dutch and Spanish and getting able to read decently. Lessons tend to be reasonably challenging. It gamifies a lot learning, which could be more encouraging for some people"
"This is a great app. I picked up navajo to learn a tonal language but sadly they don't have any audio past unit 1. Can't really learn the tones if I don't have examples Edit: the lessons in unit 3 of Navajo will not accept alternative ways writing six ""hastƒÖÃÅƒÖÃÅ"" the program either moves the accents or just doesn't accept the word without accents, I cant continue this unit until fixed"
"I paid for a subscription, so I have high expectations for this application. So far, I've only had two issues. I was completing lessons but was not able to access the leaderboard. Next, while in a lesson, I was not allowed to type my answer and had to submit blank, which gave me an incorrect answer. I hit the flag icon to report. Hopefully, these issues do not become frequent."
it holds you artificially back so your learning process is extremely slow and tedious due to the vast amount of (unnecessary) repetitions you have to make to progress. taking shortcuts to a topic you want to learn is virtually impossible. overall a very unsatisfactory experience which seems to be more interested in keeping you in the loop as a (paying) customer than actually helping you to learn the language.
"First off, I dislike that they removed the ability to read forum questions that have been asked about the lessons. Also, I would like to also learn Chinese, but it relies on teaching the symbols too much. I have no desire to write it. Please give the ability to learn pinyin instead. I wish there was a better lesson at the beginning of each section. Like, give me a list of the words I'm going to learn. Or, an explanation of reflexive verbs, for example, instead of just expecting I get it."
"I'm really confused, I am learning Chinese and all my lessons just completely changed. It says I have done 3 when I had actually done 5. And the ones it says I have finished are completely different content than when I actually did them. If you are changing the lessons I would appreciate a heads up, and accurate credit for the lessons I did. And new lessons for the ones I didn't do."
"I like this owl. The app makes it easy to learn and refresh on a language with bite-sized lessons. I enjoy the short stories, along with the ability to fix my mistakes and the chance to regain hearts. The challenge mode, where one matches words to the language's equivalent word, is quite fun."
I'm only on day three but the way it makes you use the words repeatedly in different ways and how the next day it still uses words from previous lessons so you don't forget them is great. I'm loving learning Chinese so far!
"In the 5 days I've been trying to learn Spanish, VERY HARD FOR. SOMEONE LIKE ME, but duolingo makes it very easy to learn, they go step by step, word by word, mistake by mistake, it will definitely take a while to learn but duolingo makes it go by so fast because they structure their app so well and makes the lessons in a game type forearm, if u want to learn a new language duolingo is ur best option if ur wanting to learn on the go, in the comfort of ur home, THANK YOU DUOLINGO."
"I've been using Duolingo for just over a year with about 8 months of premium - It's been largely effective at helping me learn my target languages, however the perpetual lag that the Android version has from the iOS version, constant feature cuts, and consistent issues with speech recognition cause the app to fall short of ideal."
"I love it, it helped me learn Spanish it taught me so many things and it reviewed the mistakes I made and it's so amazing I just don't like that the hearts don't get refilled until hours gone past I wish it was like 10-15 minutes but thats fine I recommend you duolingo when you want to travel and learn new languages and words you never knew! Sincerely. Kathy"
"I learned both my native language (English) and my second language (German) by practice and use, not with a book or lessons. I had been slowly learning Spanish until I started with Duolingo. The repetition and easy of using a language, not just studying, has greatly accelerated learning. I am happy to practice to earn ""hearts"" to keep going as this provides repetition which makes me even more proficient. I like the ability to start and stop. As an educator for over 20 years, I love this."
"It's a really good app for me, even tho I'm 13, I really enjoy these characters tellinge if it's correct or not. And it also doesn't have any ads which makes me real happy. I learned a lot of languages, like: French, German, Danish and Russian! So I practice this game every single morning so I can learn a lot of new words! I rate this a 5 stars!"
The app is really good. Has lots of fun languages to learn. I love that you make the app actually fun to learn so it keeps you active. I also love that you guys added a leader board to show your progress and other people's aswell. The app also requires you to focus while learning so you won't lose hearts so you can continue moving on to each section. When all your five hearts are gone you're are going to need to practice to make sure you're really understanding the topic and I love that.
"if you're interested in learning a language it's a definite grab. in just a few hours I've learned a huge amount of Spanish. yo habla Espanol üòå the UI is slick the sounds are tuned and I love the personalities, especially the Gothic Spanish girl lol. there are high scores if you wanted to be competitive. you do both verbal and written assignments and you can pace yourself , me personally I'm going all out! really want to learn Spanish this year. It's definitely worth it. üíö"
"I have decided to learn Vietnamese as a supplemental skill for my job. Asian languages are extremely difficult to learn, especially for native english speakers. Thanks to Duolingo, I have learned enough so far to communicate on a basic level with several of our customers. The idea is that we will have better business opportunities if I can connect with certain customers in their own language."
"The app used to be amazing, but now it won't allow speech practice. Everytime I 'tap to speak' it doesn't allow and automatically marks the question wrong. I have reported this at least a dozen times, as well as uninstalled/reinstalled, checked permissions and updated all to no avail."
"Duolingo has certainly improved a lot in the 2 years I've used it. There's still room for improvement with using your phone's mic in speaking lessons and it would be nice for it to show you what words mean when you are practicing hiragana more, not just on the odd occasion."
"Duolingo has to be the best language learning app I've seen but I have one problem with it, I think they kinda rushed the Korean in unit 4, it was introduced to fast, making it hard for people to learn easily. It's not easy learning up to thirty words at the same time, I think that has to be fixed"
Excellent app. Very easy to work with and easy level of understanding. You can learn at your own time and your own pace whenever and wherever you want. You can even set reminders to your daily lessons so that you don't miss the change of increasing your vocabulary everyday and you not only learn your to pronouns them but how to spell them. This app is great for language learning for all age group and it's highly rewarding.
I'm not sure if I haven't made it far enough but music is a huge part of my life and it'd be really cool if as a community you guys added songs you listen to that we can practice our listening skills as learners with. or like a lesson using a song would make it easier for my adhd brain too. a rhythmic style of learning that makes me want to sing along in a language I don't feel confident in yet sounds really awesome. also I had to use chat GPT to explain the tenses of bebo bebe and bebes
"On the one hand, the application helped me significantly with learning hiragana and katana. on the other hand, due to addictive mechanics, I devoted more time to maintaining my position in the league, almost completely excluding learning something new. After I went to another country, I connected to another version of the application and it was simply overwhelmed with advertising"
The free version is more than adequate and the adverts are not excessive. Lessons are very simple and repetitive to ensure learning. The paid for version is much better as you don't lose lives for mistakes so can study for longer. I've been learning Spanish and German. Both are very good.
"Ok all the stuff I said previously about the app is unfortunately still true. But I took away another star because every update to the app they do makes me less motivated to use this app anymore. Stop pushing me to do challenges and score points and then reduce the amount of points I get for the lessons that help me the most to actually learn the language. If anyone knows of a better app without out the woke agenda and pointless updates, let me know. This one makes me want to give up."
"Really iseful and helpful app, to learn languages! Nice GUI, friendly support, easy and understandable lessons. Although there's one con: sometimes if you have Duolingo on several devices but using them in a turn or on ocaasion, the logo of Duolingo,will turn into a somekind of ugly melteddown creature, which will be on your screen and you can't choose a logo.... 4/5."
Good for learning words and an introduction to a language but lack of explanations about grammar can be frustrating. Wish the repetition was more tailored to my progress. The gamey addictive nature creates a daily habit. Speaking & listening exercises are good for familiarity and pronunciation.
"Duolingo is a great concept and is incredibly engaging in how it gamifies learning a language. But it doesn't give you the tools to start speaking essential basics of the language right away. Rather, it seems like it took a Kindergartener's curriculum and converted it into a language course; teaching obscure animals names at the start instead of how to converse about someone's day, order food, or ask for directions."
"Gamifying learning works really well for me. The lessons are well paced, provide a useful variety of learning methods, and really help me remember the new things I've learned. I also enjoy the various mascots and their unique personalities."
Duolingo makes it fun to learn a new language! And I like how it saves the words you've learned so far so you can look through them again and see their meanings. The reward system is very encouraging and the characters have so much personality!
"Great app for learning a language, but you guys need to fix some bugs that sometimes prevent you from receiving double xp reward that you get at the end of a level or from friend quests, I've lost plenty of them until now, i hope y'all can do smth about it."
"the best app for learning a new language!! and, free! what i would suggest: for the ""select what hear"" exercise, there is no translation when you only have single words. it would be nice to have those translated also (so, when selecting them, you hear the pronunciation, but it would be good to read a translation also). thanks and keep up the good work!"
"Duolingo is a recommend app for beginners who wants to learn new languages. In my experience, this app teaches you about a language in a deep and understandable way. In this app, I learned more than I could in real life and I actually learned more than 1 language without any confusion. Kids would enjoy using this app.I would personally rate this app 5 stars. Hope this helps!!"
I deleted it. I am one step away from uninstalling. The number of words you need to translate in a sentence should never change. You are actively tripping people with ADHD up by constantly moving the target. You also never account for simple typos where two letters change places getting marked wrong for things like that is counterproductive. I clearly understand and my only error was having fat fingers. People with ADHD experience rejection sensitive dysphoria and it will turn us off the app.
"I'd rate Duolingo 4.5 out of 5 stars. It's an effective and fun way to learn a new language with its interactive lessons, gamified approach, and diverse language options. However, some users may find it lacks in-depth explanations or advanced language skills. Overall, it's a great tool for beginners and casual learners."
"Quality has been getting worse and worse. I sometimes show the excercises im learning to someone who is fluent in the language I'm learning, and they tell me that many of the translations are wrong. Even I can tell now that some of the translations are just rubbish or nonsense that would never be used by native speakers. On top of that duo ignores every problem you flag. It's like they have switched over from real translators to labotomised ai bots. I will not review my sub or recommend to other"
"During high school, I took 3 levels of Spanish class but never took them seriously. Now I decided I want to actually commit and finally learn. This is the best place to learn, and they really do a good job making it fun to learn a new language while making quick progress towards your goal. Deserves nothing less than five stars!"
Great since I started to use it. But if this reaches the dev team I'd recommend (on exercises where we have to put labels to form a phrase) to queue the audio for each word instead of just not finishing the current word.
"Used to be a wonderful learning device but since these recent updates the GUI has been terrible and the bugs even more terrible, unplayable. The only way I can keep my streak is by doing stories. Duolingo, please sort it out."
"Lately the 2x xp is not doubling the xp. You work to get a reward, you accomplish the requirements, then the app repeatedly just doesnt grant it. Why do the quests and work to place in a leaderboard when the app unreliably in it's award system anyway? Really disappointing."
"The app works great and I'm learning multiple languages. The app icon changes to a sad face of I haven't opened the app in a certain amount of time. -2 stars for attempting to guilt tripping me to use your app. I'm honestly thinking of uninstalling and learning from another source because I want to learn, not appease a Tamagotchi."
"I used to use the app all the time but since all these ads started to pop up after every single lesson, I started to use it less and less beacsue it isn't about learning how to improve your language as much anymore. And I really wish that Duolingo could stop forcing the super Duolingo down our throats all the time, it has gotten more about advertising than helping us in prove in language learning. PLEASE REMOVE THE UNNECESSARY THINGS!"
"I love the new learning path, I know it's controversial, but I think it's more motivational to me. The only problem is that some of the daily quests are a little tedious, for example, 'read the next story on your path'. However, it is a great app for free! There are a variety of languages to learn and I feel like it has really helped me learn French and Spanish. I also love that you can do a quick lesson to save your streak, so even if you are short on time, you can still do something."
"it's a very good app for learning, but the alphabets are not here so it might be a little bit difficult to pronounce. here I am learning German and I thought the alphabets and pronounce is the same as normal English but when I looked in Google the pronouncetion was different. that's the only problem I can think of . either that this app very useful.. from India üáÆüá≥"
"Duelingo is super fun in super educational . You should let your kids get it if they want to learn a second third or any any number of languages, and if they wanna learn multiple languages at once, they have the option to work on like 3 or more different languages. And it's helped me a lot on understanding Spanish. So I can talk to family."
"Love this app and I'm trusting that I'm learning well because I'm dreaming Spanish words now lol. Improvements: It would be great to practise all the words you learn and to have the translation of the sentences, even when you get them right. I've been using the app pretty much every day and it's a great new addiction! I'm addicted to the rewards and seeing my friends' progress making it almost a battle to be great! it's so infectious my housemate wants in on the fun too üòÇ"
"Hey duo, I used to love the app back then there were no hearts and I can learn as much as possible but I'm not requesting to remove hearts or something. I'm just asking to improve it. Like make hearts available for levels than on total or else a fuel strat like in asphalt games so that I can learn 5 lessons or something everyday. Also can you take care of the ad management? It's really annoying sometimes, like you can do something like Spotify does, watch an add and learn for 15 minutes?"
"This could be a great app, but the examples to use to learn a language are far detached from reality. Why should someone starting to learn a language knows what is an actor or a engineer??? A beginner needs to know things like right and left, or learn how to count; just usefull stuff. But Duolingo STARTS with words in you might never need even if you advanced in a language."
"I have loved the multi- pronged approach of DuoLingo including listening, speaking and writing, stories and exercises, and so much more. what I have found challenging is that a less formal way of speaking often found ""in the street"" is not acceptable in the exercises. Also, challenging is there seems to be no way to earn hearts that are taken when a mistake is made except to watch ads. Perhaps having hearts earned when a level of competence is demonstrated would be a way to continue learning."
"Duolingo is a great free language learning app. You can learn multiple languages at the same time and their strategies are very helpful. You practice listening, speaking and writing in those languages. Another fun aspect is that you can challenge your friends and work together to complete friend quests! You can add them, give them gifts and congratulate each other for their hard work learning. It is a marvelous app and you should give it a try! üëåüá´üá∑üá©üá™üá¶üá™üá™üá∏üá∞üá∑"
I love this app. I do it at least twice per day. Huge fan. But lately it's super glitchy. It keeps freezing up. I hope it can get sorted out soon. Seriously considering something that rhymes with scrabble right now.
"A good course but, irritatingly it uses American English. I studied mathematics, not math and I actually go to the cinema (Italian word cinema) not a movie theatre. I have to come back to this and take off a star. This course was written by an American script writer. It's Police not Cops, autumn not fall. Secondly, some of the Italian words are not the same as would be everyday. I have an Italian course on Audible and there are significant variations."
App in itself works great so far. Can't seem to receive the text notifications when trying to link to my contacts. I googled and found its a known issue? But this was from 3 months ago so.... is the app having issues?
"Hi developers! One star for forced ""Sad Duo"" app icon. I actually really enjoy the app, but hate having my home screen messed with. Return the option for a static app icon (such an easy fix!) and it's a 5-star app for me."
"Great app for learning the basics of French and probably any other language it offers. I'm very satisfied with it. Even though one cannot rely on it only to speak a new language more fluently, I still highly recommend this app for beginners!"
"Great app, but the issues I'm having trying to upgrade from individual to a family plan are causing me to knock off 4 stars. The directions in the help center are useless as none of the options exist."
The app is useful and a fun way to learn a new language. I like how it teaches you the language from step one. The characters are fun to. However there are adds but not many. Overall a fun app.
"this helps alot for learning languages slowly, I just wish there was more to choose from. I d9nt understand why there's a meme of duolingo going to kill you,like yeah it's a joke but it doesn't make sense.. Overall Duolingo is a good learning app. just wish there's more languages to choose"
Pretty easy to follow. The lessons are sometimes a guessing game so it doesn't feel like I'm actually learning. But simple sentences are becoming second nature to speak. so it's effective.
Usted to be good app... now plenty of exercises to repeat what your hear. Plenty to read ... but no really exercises to translate sentences. Why? I used to learn a lot with making mistakes while trying to translate sentences. Now it's been reduced a lot so I'm switching to different apps I'm afraid. I feel that I'm loosing what I learned through few last years ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"This is a good way to learn a language. however, I'm changing my review since the last update due to me being so close to a 100-day streak, and the next day, they wiped my streak clean, I spent hours upon hours on this and they just done me dirty, and took $8 from me and it still didn't give my streak back... Fix your app"
"it's working well although sometimes the speech mode is painful. After using this app for 3 months I have issues. There is little rotation in the speech lessons and words sections. I use it to review but get the same patterns all the time. I also have issues with the speach not accepting anything I say or any way pronounced . And, how do people get 9,000 points in 2 hours of new level opening? There need to be grammar rules to help understand."
"I bought super Duolingo and used it to learn Hindi. Really good app to learn. But need more sentences, vocabulary and grammar for Hindi. Not sure how it is for other languages. Please add more Hindi lessons for various scenarios with more sentences, words and grammar"
"This is written by a 1000-day-streak achiever:It's been nearly 3 years since I started my Spanish learning journey and It is the convenience that makes the majority of us users think this green owl is a really effective language learning assistant. Having said that, it's all marketing's fault to promote your app as a free app! My hatred for how this app treats its free users is as ineffably enormous as how I detest capitalism! I know all of your tricks to force us to upgrade, just stop it!"
"Absolutely amazing. I cannot believe that this app has a YouTube channel. There was a bug that I found that even with animations turned on, the animations are stuck but still intractable. Please fix this bug so I can still be satisfied of how smooth your animation is. Thank you, Duolingo."
"This is best for continuing language practice when you've already studied a language. There isn't much structure or explanation behind grammatical rules or vocab. It's more of a pseudo immersion with some things but there's often little to no context with new vocab. Other issue is there's almost no wiggle room with sentence translation. It has to be the exact, translated wording that is programmed, or it's wrong. e.g. ""I also did this""/""I did this also""-only one of these would be correct."
"I was charged for one year with the usual ""you at some point accepted our sketchy terms so we'll take your money bye"". Tried to contact them through many different channels. Edit: Got refunded after mailing really difficult to find support email address. Ads are not intrusive but they are on very idiotic topics for being hosted on a learning app.."
I've actually taught myself three languages. I love this app but I've been robbed of free super duolingo about 5 times because of errors and I wish there was a way to get people to talk to for practice. Hook me up duolingo I will give you a 5 star if u send some promos my way
"200+ days: Not an effective way to learn for me (rote memorization).UI elements too small. Paying but no replies to bug reports/issues, ever. Gamification/animations got irritating Grammar/honorifics explanations thin and/or inconsistent No explanation of kanji: how to write, radicals I find it infeasible to memorize 1000+ kanji without that context Especially on mobile fonts are too small, no way to adjust. Makes kanji illegible. Reported all of this to support, no response."
turns into more of a game than actually learning the language. there is definitely learning happening...but when you make a mistake there is no teaching that happens. I recommend using another app that actually teaches the language while also using this app (for fun and getting more reps). also I'm having a heck of a time using the speaking function for the app as well. can't figure it out. Add some teaching points and make the speaking tool flawless...I will give it a 5.
"They don't reply to emails. Edit: Don't remember why I put that, so I'mma leave it there. The app's good to learn languages. Update: Please Fix this app. It's very unresponsive Wow what a sudden turn of events y'all have made! Got too much greedy all of sudden! Boo to you all. 4 hours for hearts to refill? So in a way you are discouraging people to use this platform and find alternative! Good work pushing off your user base! Edit: Duolingo is not fun for me! Everyone's racing. Stressful."
"Prices for the premium are really high and it teaches japanese slang but doesnt tell you its slang. Once they specify or fix that, and maybe lower the prices a little bit, easy 5 star app. Intuitive, very helpful, and can be a quick way to learn any language's basics."
absolutely love the app! great for all aspects of learning a language and you can start at any level. the revards sytem is amazing also earning points and badges. As well as battling your friends and quests to compleate. is almost the perfect app. i find it difficult the matching words because once you match the words the new that appear are kind of having a lag begor ethey appear and thus hard to overcome the time count.
I have a one year streak and paid for super Duolingo. I feel like I've wasted a year on this app. It's like a game that's not fun and you won't really learn anything. Trust me and find nearly any other learning option. For some languages like Japanese there are excellent games on Steam that will teach you so much more in a day versus a month on Duolingo. It also doesn't support traditional Chinese. This app has filled me with regret. Please learn from my experience. Avoid.
I am learning French language and I think that this is the best app ever I have tried. because I downloaded many apps to learn French but they were soo boring and I couldn't understand anything. but this is so much interesting and good. I understand and remember all the things I am learning......... Thank you.............
"A very good app to learn single or with friends! üëç The only think i don't like is that you loose your streak very easy and it somehow forces you to make a lesson or something every day and it's sometimes kinda annoying because you have a lot of extra things to do, not just to do lessons. And also you loose so easy the league position but it's not your fault that other ppl go on try-hard playing and practicing 24/7. Anyways, is a nice and freindly app where, as how I said, its easy to learnüòÉ"
"While I'll confess the app helped me in my quest to learn Japanese, I'm greatly disappointed by how it all ended. I completed my Japanese course yesterday and I didn't get anything to indicate the completion of the course. No congratulatory message, no badge, no email, nothing! It's really frustrating to think that an app that celebrates far inferior achievements would totally disregard two years of daily learning commitments and a final course completion. I'm disappointed in Duolingo."
"I think I found an interim solution. Instead of having a cache of all the sentences studied since the beginning, perhaps compiling the sentences studied in a particular lesson and showing them at the end of that particular lesson(without storing the information longterm) would be the way to go. I believe in addition to the list of words in the review section, this would suffice for the time being. I applaud your efforts towards creating an ideal platform to help people learn new languages. Danke"
"Learning mainly Japanese. Used to be a good. Quite trash now. Every now and then there is a huge update where it changes the structure of the lessons. It introduces completely new words in previous lessons I've already completed. So, when I do a revision lesson sometimes it would just give me new words, grammar, verbs and tenses without any warning. Very disappointed that the ""updates"" do not account for this. Unfortunately my streak is too significant to stop now."
"I had heard some criticisms about the teaching method, but after using it a bit I have come to the conclusion that Duolingo is using very advanced psychology to sneak the language into your brain through easy games that don't feel like learning"
"For nearly a decade, I've been a top 2% competitive user across 10 languages. Every interface change causes a setback, leading me to cancel my premium subscription and cease competing. Alternative language learning methods, & conversations are key. I particularly valued Duolingo's inclusion of different alphabets & translatable stories which they've limited greatly. When my 535 day streak dies ill be partially sad but also relieved and will move on from the app entirely."
I use to really enjoy this app until the hearts came on the scene. Sometimes I have accidentally hit continue when I'm not done and I lose a heart. It's just an attempt to get users to buy Duolingo Plus. Not gonna happen here. The app now has a glitch that won't let me progress. It goes back to the beginning of that unit . If it continues then I'll drop it.
"I used to love learning Japanese on this app, but that was only until the update 2 days ago. When I logged on, I noticed I was pushed forward an ENTIRE SECTION and 20 something units! When I look back on all the lessons, I've realized that there are around 200 or so words it skipped me past that I had no chance to learn. This new update is infuriating, and I forsee a terrible outcome for this app. Once the best, now the worst. Please fix this."
"My whole family are leaning a language. I'm English, my partner is from Eastern Europe, my parents holiday in turkey. Everyone is using the family plan now and loving it. I can talk and understand family. it's fun, not too taxing, and imo worth the subscription. Particularly with the family plan! It takes a while to get going, but once you get a streak it's really really encouraging to keep going and keep practicing!"
It's easy and fun but your going to make mistakes and they want you to pay to not worry. I get a lot of practice and I'm learning Italian and Spanish and im mostly doing Spanish and its fun and easy to understand. Awesome app for language learning and with super duolingo I've been able to learn Spanish and several other languages and it's a lot of fun. Love this app. Easy to give 5 stars for helping a guy with a gunshot to the head to learn another language and help other people. TYSVM!
been on DUOLINGO for about a year and some change took a two month break and came back to a pretty decent update. Vikram radio is cool and a welcome edition. I just wish I could play pass my 5 hearts. :: (update) I can practice as much as I want and still level up!!! Duolingo is a great learning experience and also very fun.
"I love the way the lessons are set up - perfect for these of us with limited time - squishing lessons in wherever possible. They really seem to have figured out how to maximize learning. My only negative is that I wish ALL the answers were translated right OR wrong. Most are, but sometimes there's a word I'm not sure of, and make an educated guess, only to get ""Great Job"" and end up going for the dictionary so I know what that word meant."
"I'm doing French and German at 'rusty' level - so not quite beginner . The French is OK but the vocabulary choices for German are bizarre. At my level the likely use is for travel. I don't need to know the words for lawyer, or chess, or Chancellor. I want to buy bus tickets, order food and drink, and check which platform my train leaves from. I think I'll be digging out my Berlitz phrasebook - much more useful."
"It is a very fun learning app, but I am concerned about how if you miss your lesson duo, a friendly bird will literally ATACK YOU, and some of my friends deleted duo like, my friend Anna. She downloaded duolingo, and she had a 692 strike *very impressive* and she deleted it because it was stressing her out she she deleted it and 1 month goes by and duo just keeps sending notifications saying ""let's practice"" and more also there are a lot of bugs in the app but I recommend it all you guys"
"It's fun at first but after awhile it gets a little repetitive. Also, currently I'm learning Hebrew and it doesn't really teaxh feminine vs masculine words. Besides this Duolingo is a fun way to learn a language."
Update: Now the app won't even start neither on my phone nor on my tablet! üòûüòûüòû Update: The new update ruined it all. I just hope they revert the changes. üòûUpdate: As a Plus member it's great. I like the new content and the new exercise types. Previous update: Since introducing the hearts system it's worse if you are not subscribed to Plus. Original review: Wow! So far very happy with it. Seems to be very efficient.
"Visited three Spanish speaking countries within the last five years and fell in love with the language. Duolingo has exceeded every expectation and preconception I had about the app. I have used it for a total for 2 hours throughout the day. I can honestly say I enjoy learning using duolingo, being constantly motivated with a wide variety of learning patterns and structures as well as multi sensory learning based activities. Would highly recommend as the best way to learn a new language. 10 / 10"
"I feel like the ads after EVERY lesson are a little much, and you should learn numbers, conversations, and greetings BEFORE learning food and accessories. Other than that, the app is pretty good, I've had it for nearly 5 years, and it's helped with my German and Italian quite a bit."
"Downgrade to one star until the glitches are fixed. The newest update is the worst. The app freezes when I try opening it, and if I click on a lesson to begin, it doesn't open right away. I have to click on it a few times before it starts. Wish I could uninstall this update and go back to the way it was."
"Great app it helps you a lot. Would highly recommend but there are adds that the app adds in. They don't pop up often. The only thing that could be fixed is that sometimes it will add in updates taking you back several stages. Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do about it and you will have to work your way back up."
"learing German it's a very motivating app, but there are a few translations that don't explain the words fully. The app needs more Proofreading. Otherwise it's a fun app that makes learing a new language more approachable. I don't think I would truly be fluent unless I actually spent some time in a German speaking country, but this app dose make me feel like I have an upper hand in learning it. If you are interested in any languages I would recommend giving it a download."
"While it's a decent system to do maintenance on a language, I don't feel like it's the best to learn an actual language. Recent changes made ads ridiculously long and make the app experience just a chore. It's all a bit expensive, plus is not worth the money. I might be done with this."
"Good app and fun. but some errors found. for exemple, the cat (gato) is used as someone's friend working in an office. I think AI compiled some (or all) exercises. With the Xps score ranking every week, Learning will be more fun with Duolingo if you have friends to Lear together. You can follow other learners and get inspired."
I really like this app!!! Duolingo is very helpful. I told myself that I wanted to start being adamant about learning Spanish and then I moved to French. now I am doing both!!! I may go ahead and consider super duolingo because of the unlimited perks. I recommend to anyone wanting to learn Spanish or any language. it's helpful!!!!! Thanks Duo!!!!!!!!
"It's appalling and frustrating using this app since the previous two updates. I can now log in to the app but I'm stuck doing a story lesson without progressing. When I do my lesson using the browser widget, it doesn't update my progress on the app. So I'm at different stages in the app and in the chrome browser widget. I I've lost my friend quests and I can't meet up my daily learning goals. It's no longer a habit learning on Duolingo, but a chore - one I don't look forward to anymore."
"I am learning two languages, Spanish and Hebrew. The Spanish portion is great. The Hebrew portion of the app seems incomplete- not being able to click on a work and hear it as well as the slower speech function (turtle) doesn't seem to work at all. I need a lot more help in the listening portion of my Hebrew."
"There are a lot features I am missing compared to normal. I am completely unable to do speaking lessons on the Android app, my course never updates. I have troubleshooted and even reported the issues and gotten nowhere, not only that but I have even seen the official YouTube channel joke about their buggy app and seemingly do nothing. I've been learning Spanish for a year and a half and had Super Duolingo for a year but it feels like they haven't updated or fixed anything in all that time."
"Duolingo is a very good app. The app is very motivating and encouraging, and that is (at least one of) its biggest strength(s). It uses reading, writing, listening, and speaking in the exercises. I have used it for just a couple of days, so my review is due to my limited experience with the app."
"I do like this app, and it does tech you the words and the meanings, but I do feel like they need to add more where you can learn how to pronounce and speak the language more than just being able to understand it and hear it. Like I know more words but I find it hard to remember when it gives me more just listening and clicking the meaning."
"Speaking from someone who loves learning new languages when bored, this app is great (if u don't miss a day). I have learnt new languages by far and I'm aiming for Korean cuz i can't look at the subtitles and watch at the same time. It's not like i have 4 eyes. Best of the best. Recommend 100. Even though you have 5 hearts u can still lose them and buy or learn again to get them. There's premium which means infine hearts for y'all"
"I wanted to give it a try again since my first experience with learning Korean was bad here. Now that I was learning at beginner to intermediate level, it was going well. But nowadays the app doesn't open n so I am close to missing my streaks. All the time. I can't practice even when I make time n it's frustrating üòû. If I were to loose a streak cuz of this issue I'll be disappointed n have no choice but to give up on this app again and move on to something else."
"It's a pity this app is rather buggy and unstable. It freezes up regularly and needs to be force-stopped to regain control. Duolingo really puts learning a language within reach. When one has the time, one can easily spend more than an hour a day learning. But in a pinch, one can easily do just 10 minutes on the bus or train to keep advancing."
"Alright but doesn't really give you fluency. There is a tendency to play tjd game rather than learn effectively. It is not the only way you should learn, i tale weekly lessons also. Im trying to learn Spanish but it predominantly teaches you south American Spanish (despite the Spanish flag) which is very different. It should have an option for proper Spanish."
"Not one of, it's the best app I've ever used for learning languages. Its definitely not like the other apps that bore you to death and make you feel like your as useless as a life guard in the desert. Since it's designed like a game, its not only gonna keep you consistent but also gonna help you to learn which language you want, whenever you want. Let duo cook."
"It's great, but the xp system is a farce once you realise it's not only their to temp competitiveness but is made easy mode by going premium. The ads were manageable at first but now every single lesson has a noisy ad after it, I just do one lesson then close the app on the ad. Getting really tired of it, was going to go super but feel I'm being coerced in to it so might look at other language learning options instead. Some lessons intentionally try to trip you up to cost hearts and dishearten"
"Duolingo is easy and fun I've learned more in 2 weeks in Duolibgo than I learned in 6 weeks a classroom. There's no pressure with Duolingo, you can correct errors, you get practice sets and work at your own paste . I will continue Duolingo training. Thank you for this opportunity Duolingo."
"I love this app, its a great tool, I would have given it 5 star but for some reason the maths and music courses aren't available on my phone but I have the latest update and a friend of mine has both the maths and music courses however I don't. I would really appreciate if you could look in to both of there issues, thanks üòä"
Duolingo is very good with it's tactics to learning a language I'm learning Korean and how it's built like. However there is a minor problem for me BC sometimes when U do a speaking exercise where it requires U to speak once you are done speaking it just keeps pending and it won't go through and then I have to quite all me progress and start again BC the lesson won't continue unless the speaking exercise stops pending and I'm telling U it won't go through. Duo pls remove them bugs from this app.
"Amazing app that encourages free learning with great social aspects. However, desperately needs a catch-up mechanism when they revise their curriculum, leaving you with a whole set of new vocabulary that you were never taught... Seriously disappointed in that respect."
"This app is good. I understand arabic way more better than before but one thing that i wanna complain about is how the Ai voice that's teaching me(or whatever), keeps disappearing and at first i thought my phone was lagging, but it isn't my phone it is Duolingo.. and also my screen keeps freezing/blacking out after or whenever i finish a lesson. I really hope duolingo sees this and updates the app, im frustrated and sad:(."
I really like the app. it has a funny reminders that keep you in check and keep you pushing to learn the language you chose. I'm learning Japanese so it's really fun I can cheer my friends on and it let's my take my time so that I can fully understand the words and how to pronounce it. I know it's already doing so much but I would hope they would add like a flash cards so I can practice aside from the units of all the words I learned. but all around a fun and good app.
Brilliant app. Never realised learning a language could be such fun. Approaching 50 I was concerned my memory was going but this app has reassured me that I can still learn quickly and effectively. Can advance quite quickly and the nature of the exercises really helps to reinforce the words and phrases. Even on the free version the ads arent intrusive. Really excited to carry on learning!
I have tried other apps to help learn languages but this is by far the most effective and enjoyable one for me. It is very good about teaching in a way that is repetitive yet still progressive. It does a good job of explaining things in a simple and still though manner.
"I had to restart my Japanese coarse beacuse an update droped me in a spot far beyond my level. It also have this annoying design on learning katakana and hiragana where the further you progress, the longer each step gets, to the point they are twice as long as the normal class. And the speed classes reach points where there are so many words it's impossible to succeed without buying extra time."
"A fantastic way to learn a language whilst on the go. I can practice whether on the tube, bus, walking or as a ritual when waking in the morning or last thing at night. Achieving is good for mental health, a suggestion would be to listen and practice with this app instead of listening to the miserable news on the TV or radio. YOLO"
"Good language learning app. It has all the things needed to learn a language, in a fun way for different language speakers. It even gives out the answer when needed help. It has hearts to make it even more challenging. Though I can still suggest one thing to duolingo, You need to add a SHOP section to your app to claim the chests and see how much you have to wait more. Also in the SHOP section we can buy hats, etc. and race with other people on who can complete the same random lesson first."
"Editing my review , the daily quests are boring , especially that one quest where you have to spend 15 minutes learning is very annoying it comes almost everyday, please change the quest don't force me spend 15 mins learning , sometimes i am not in mood of doing that but i also don't want to lose my quest streak"
It was good during the novice stage. But in the second stage it expects you to know things it hasn't taught you and then fails you. Very fustrating. And it gives guidance on how to translate that it then rejects as an error!! Hasn't got any better. Still can't suggest the correct answer half the time
"It's great to commit to the daily habit of learning, but your progress will be limited by the easiness of some skills and words that keep repeating even after committing for 3 years. sometimes I wished the games took into account the vocabulary that are more difficult to learn so I could really remember them"
"I do not know why but the app is crashing quite frequently. I don't know why it crashes maybe my phone is not supporting it or maybe there is a bug? But if anything can be done please do it. Other then that, your app is really nice and I would love to use it more but the frequent crashes really make it difficult for me. Also after crashing for once it keeps lagging and the frequency of it crashing also increases. Well, ATE, the app is really nice and intertainin and most importantly,reallyuseful"
Spent months on a French course that is now stuck on level 10. I made the jump to level 11 several times but then I get a message that says the course has been updated and I'm back on level 10. I sent several emails to developers with no answer or solution. French course is useless now. Disappointed.
"Though there are some problems I find this as an okay app. Some people might complain about how lessons are repeated over and over but that's only so you can actually remember the words (probably) Also, I don't see the math and music options even when I updated the apps. Idk why this is happening"
I really like Duolingo. I have used it for years now on a daily basis without any problem until recently. But lately I have had a bug in the Spanish course. It will not let me proceed to the next section. It is stuck there. I wrote the Android support site over a week ago but I have had no response. Clearly the Duolingo support system is not where it should be if you run into problems. Alas. I am still able to use it for other languages without any difficulty
"I now speak perfect Spanish because of this app and it cleaned up my free time. I really enjoyed it being supportive through my journey of learning and help coach me through everything. I honestly think you should try this app because it was really helpful and you can play it anytime! Before and after you preferred time and it helps you speak a new and perfect language for free! It was a game changer and life saver because now I can teach other kids my age, older and younger, to speak Spanish ."
This app is really helping me learn Spanish and many other languages much faster!! I love it!! but there's only one problem it's that people who want an add free experience have to pay a certain amount and some people can't so it makes us finish our coarse slower and is very distractive.I hope this problem is solved further on and v get some updates üòÉ
In my opinion I see that duo is a very goodapp for learning any language and its one of the most rare apps that if you tried the upgraded option it will give u a super experience in learning any language and it makes u hear the language from different sounds and that's incredible +it always reminds u with your daily streak which can help u reach your language goals but I wish that you can make the microphone a bit better cuz sometimes it doesn't give me the accurate check of the words k.going
"I heard the old japanese system was complete trash... but I got into this re entry from a friend and the system is great and really been keeping me interested as I been working on learning Japanese on and off over the last few years. I really like a lot of the systems in place while I do have small issues with Grammer choices made as the ""correct"" answers reporting anything wrong seems easy. my mane issues is the small Grammer stuff and the app saying I missed whole days I didn't."
"I find this app to be a calmer way to learn a different language as I have trouble with words at times and It would have felt wrong trying on college course so I was made up when I found this app, for anyone looking in to starting this , don't be put off when you see the account you don't have to pay up front and you are given the choose to get the normal mode or you can go for the Super one its your choice, i am seeing how i get on with normal for now BUT IT IS A VERY GOOD APP TOO GET"
"I used duolingo for German casually for an overseas trip and it was a puzzle piece fit. Recently started using it again for Japanese on a whim from watching subtitled shows and I've forgotten how fun it is as a game; 11/10 would recommend, very fun for those who are gamer-minded and enjoy learning. I only wish I had stuck with it the first time around but I'm looking forward to picking up where I left off."
"It's a good app, but listen- I want to learn from my mistakes, not watch ads from my mistakes. I'm trying to learn, not to watch an animated mother freezing to death with her animated baby in a broken house."
"Soo much fun! Been wanting to learn Spanish for a long time, so glad I came across this app! I practice and learn everyday. The best part is feeling rewarded when you are doing well. Doulingo has made it is easy for me to start at a beginners level while slowly building up my vocabulary. Gives you options to correct your mistakes and weak points as well. Iv been learning for 3 weeks now nonstop and haven't paid a cent! I will eventually buy this for the extra teaching perks."
This is a very great app.I would like to recommend you to try the app. It is really helpful for learning any language. I am currently learning korean. It is fun in learning.You can also create your own streak.If you are unable to do 1 lesson a day or you miss it than your streak will be freezed but not counted as your increasing streak.It will remain the same. Do give a try to this app.üëçüëç
Leaders of Duolingo. HELP! 560 day streak about to go down the tube. All I get are error messages. I've almost used all freezes. I've Uninstalled and reinstalled and nothing changed.
"You have to appreciate the beginner lessons and the chance to tap into a foreign language for free or very little money. Once you progress through the levels unfortunately the number of bugs and app errors is very big. Obviously not enough app testing, Duolingo crew !!! (+1 year daily user)"
"There are better apps to learn languages. This one often has bugs so you can't complete responses and repeats phrases that I already know very well and I waste hours on content already learned. They don't have a good SRS method for bringing words back that were new in previous modules so you'll never truly have them down without creating your own flash card system. I really like the app Lingq so if you want to start with this one for free to gain basics, quickly move to a different app."
"It a great app for learning new languages. Its just that there is this one languge that native to South Africa and that is Afrikaans. I couldn't find Afrikaans as one of the languages you could learn. It would be great if new people could learn Afrikaans as it is a dying language. Thats the only problem I have, everything else is great."
"Mar2024, dev just released new version and everything is a mess. Sound drops so low its barely audible with sound so high on phone. Ads are blasting loud. Dev still thinks candyland is the way to study languages. 30jan2023.single path version, my study has been so much worse. Picked up 2 other apps to study with. New version is super difficult to efficiently review lessons. Studying languages isnt a game and u destroyed what made your app great. CHANGE IT BACK to 2022. Listen to your users."
"The community leaderboard is a big part of the gamification behind this app, which makes it fun to play. It's a nice app, but the leadership board is so glitchy that it takes the fun away for me. When you grind out a lot of points to progress, only for them not to show up and you get bumped down for another week, it's a bummer."
The beyond stupid sentences that you would never use unless extremely high or equally drunk. I found Busuu that uses sentences that you'd actually use & have people of that language speaking it. And also get help with your mistakes by people that know the language. Once July comes around I'm buying a membership to Busuu & not going to touch this app again. Also the running out of hearts gets beyond frustrating when you're almost done but lose the progress because no more hearts
"Unfortunately, the point count is now broken. I have to always check the score to make sure it is updated. And then restart the app if it does not update. After the restart, it usually catches up, but you lose the bonus time. Today, it just stopped updating the points even with all the restarts. There was an app update available, but that didn't help with the count."
"I love learning on Duolingo! And the app functions well. I would just love to see more options to practice quietly sans microphone or audio. I often find myself in situations where I wish I could read or play but need to be quiet. I would also LOVE to play the matching game without getting cut off for speed. The race turns me off. I'm not going anywhere but I would love to see more lesson types added. Ty, Duo! PS, The competition of leagues really inspires me! Please keep those!"
The app is great and in fact the reminder notifications are wonderful. But where I do have a problem is in those stories where a man's girlfriend is a man and where a woman's boyfriend is a woman. I am not comfortable with it and I think there are others also who are not comfortable learning with these concepts in place. I would be grateful if there can be a way one can choose to filter that off. Thanks
"I passed the 3 levels in the level three in the ""xp ramp challenge"", but it won't record my result to pass the final level, then I would fail and redo the whole level 3 over and over again. It's so frustrating as if we are made to fail and had to buy the extra time ."
"I am giving this app 4 stars because there are some bugs and glitches 1) Sometime it doesn't accept my answer and give it automatically wrong 2) This glitch is in the match the column , Sometime the word sounds like other word but the word didn't available in the column 3) Sometimes everybody has some important work and they can't attend duolingo for some days and what this app do break their streak I know they give us freeze streak option but only two ? Why please increase some amount"
"not all language cover speaking. difficult to learn because there is no explanation for errors, just the answer. must still have a grammar book no matter what is said. silly competition that is rigged with dummy players an bugs in computing extra points... distraction from being seriouslearning, especially the paid upgrade...don't, not worth the money unless you are gaming the system!"
"Honest to goodness, I've been learning languages at a blinding speed, even in the early stages! I would heavily recommend this app to people who've been wanting to learn a new language. It's engaging, educational, and at a very fair price! What more could you ask for?"
"It was great until I discovered offline lessons are not a thing anymore. I will be offline while travelling for a few days, duolingo would have been perfect during down time before going to bed, but I guess it won't be possible. It was a thing in 2021, now it only download a miserable number of lessons that you will complete in half an hour maximum. Would be a 5 stars if not for that ridiculous decision."
0 üåü they just updated the Chinese & it's all new stuff I've never learned. instead of letting me learn it as new it has it marked as review so I get 5xp instead of 10. it doesn't teach new words and hints are missing. words that have been taught 3+ years are now different. I reported issues for Years & nothing changed. now everything is different but they aren't allowing us to learn it as brand new. I pay for this and I'm really disappointed. I used to recommend this app. I don't anymore.
"Spanish - 5/5 Japanese - 2.5/5 Japanese course: 1. Severely underdeveloped (for ~7 years now). 2. No speaking exercises. 3. Awesome new kanji feature, but no way to select and practice the specific kanji you want; you can only practice the ""family"" it's in (grab bag of ~10 kanji). 4. No way to ""test out"" of kana or kanji, so seasoned learners suffer, stuck practicing beginner/well-known characters instead of the ones they need. 5. Can't test out of a single level, even if acing it. Frustrating!!"
"Not the greatest. While duolingo has some pretty good benefits, it's also got some cons to be wary about before installing this. 1, you only have 5 hearts. Which sucks when you are trying to learn multiple languages. 2, you can't choose if you want to join a tournament, once you do a lesson, your in it. Which sucks when you don't have enough time to do lesson after lesson. Overall, it's still a pretty good app, runs smoothly, and I can connect with my friends and my family. Definitely recommend."
"This learning application is exceptionally well-designed and effective. The subtle and gentle reminders serve as effective motivators to maintain consistent learning progress. Overall, I am highly satisfied with the application's performance. As a reminder, it is crucial to maintain your daily learning streak to optimize your learning outcomes and to keep the Duolingo bird happy! üòÇ"
"It's free and I have already learned some grammar. I had a half assed German class in elementary school and so the first few lessons are a bit boring as I already know them, but now it is getting a bit interesting about two weeks in. I really like that you can even use it in public spaces like on the bus as it works even with tapping input only, great idea."
"More game than learning tool. Essentially a match game for language. I have a really good ear so I'm getting a lot of ""correct"" answers, but I don't feel like I'm learning a language. Some of the phrases are RIDICULOUS and would never be in any normal conversation. Most importantly there is NO conversation. It doesn't facilitate you actually SPEAKING the language. I don't find it helpful. Pimsleur is way better."
"I have skeptical about learning a new language from an app, when it cost so much more to learn from experienced teachers going through structured course. But I was wrong. Duolingo uses Gamification and Spaced repetition to make learning languages effective and fun. Well worth the subscription."
"Its not the best app to learn but you can't get anything better than it for free. I enjoy learning here. Learning Spanish through this app is comparatively easy. That little birdie keeps me entertained. Edit: I stopped using Duolingo for language learning a long ago. Stopped learning Korean and Spanish. Just a few months ago I decided to learn again since Duo is fun and entertaining. Currently I am learning Arabic, Italian and Japanese. And Dou has improved a lot within these years."
"I have fully completed the duolingo hindi course. What I have found is that my reading is almost perfect, but I have not gained a good use of vocabulary. I did not even know the word 'goodbye.' Whenever I try to do 'daily hindi lessons', they never give me anything useful. I have forgotten the word salty, for these 'revision' sessions to say things like 'Neha cannot sing better than grandmother.' These are things I wish for Duolingo to improve on. Thanks."
"i feel like this app is focused more on Hangul characters than learning the language itself. my goal is to be able to learn phrases and sentences that are related to daily life and able to hear the actual words, phrases or sentences with a native speaker. i feel like this app is good only to memorize hangul characters and practice to read and end goal is to read the caption from youtube or kdrama. Other than that it's still good since i was able to practice reading in hangul characters"
"Terrible update. I was in Duolingo premium learning French, and after the update the voice recognition has gone to the dogs. It's like the AI was trained on screaming goats, it doesn't recognize anything as correct. Moreover, the match puzzles now hang in between, so even if I know the translation I can't match, increasing my time arbitrarily. Sometimes, my 2XP boosts suddenly disappear after I claim them."
I really enjoy that the repetition helps the lessons sink in and that you can change the words to only be in the writing style of the language you're learning. I wish there were more lessons on the sentence structure and logic behind it.
"I like the app...when it works. Don't sign up with Facebook or Google, it breaksfrequently, and there's zero support. I was about to subscribe, and it's broken so bad even a factory reset of my phone won't solve it. I am now unable to use the app without a PC. Babbel it is... sure wish support would reach out and help solve this."
Really good no ads and VERY fun I know this is sometimes a meme but really good üòä so yeah really good and at the beginning there is a type of quiz but...THER IS NO WRONG ANSWER! There is also a music learning and math learning but I can't tell you that much because it doesn't work on Android Anyways back to learning languages you might say it's gonna be quick.. BUT ITS NOT it will take well depends what language I'm learning french pand I'm finishing learning it in about 42 days I mean longer
This app is very useful. You can learn any language through it. It is friendly and gives you another chance to correct your mistake. It has many leagues where you can compete with others in the game of learning. It gives us the interest to learn more than usual because it teaches us very friendly and playfully. Very much thanks to Duolingo to make this app.
"I gave you 2 stars before but I'm now reducing it to one and deleting the app. Not just that it's always showing offline, it doesn't say out some audio lessons. Infact I'm to vexxed to continue using the app."
"Japanese Section 2 Unit 5, when you finish a lesson the progress circle doesn't advance and your next lesson is the same one you just did. The only way to work around it is to shutdown the app and start it again, then you can see your new progress and start your new lesson, but when you complete the new lesson, the issue happens all over again and you have to shutdown again."
"As I use ""my answers should be accepted"" option , there is no response from duolingo for that . When I cleared quests sometimes due to network issue or anything but the counting of quest achievement is not recorded. Also try to make the quests simple and make learning happy I know that's your aim point I appreciate it."
"I have tried many different language apps throughout the years, but this is by far my favorite. It's been a great supplement to my language studies, because it's fun and feel more like a game than actual studying. The free version is great on it's own, but it's definitely worth paying for Duolingo Plus if you want to get the most of this app. Highly recommend!"
"It keeps improving over time. I like that the variety in lessons has increased as well. My only issue is that some of the characters have poor Japanese pronunciation that can lead to confusion. I already have a foundation in the language, but this could potentially make it much more difficult for a newcomer."
"It's a fun way to learn a language. The leagues are a motivational way to make you want to keep learning. But sometimes it can feel a little repetitive, and if you take the test to see how much you know in the beginning it doesn't really work so I would recommend just doing one of the jump here tests instead. Overall, it's a good language app."
"this was a great app, for some reason the last update is making the speech tasks very slow and it isn't properly counting XP. Also of note, there is no in-app help or trouble ticket system, and they are not responsive to emails. I used to love doing lessons every day, it has started to feel like a chore because of the bugs."
"I love Duolingo! I am learning nine languages and I never thought that I would be able to do that, Duo keeps me updated on where I am and is not too annoying with the notifications (that you can turn off) I am learning fast and after almost one year I am fluent-ish in two languages. Duolingo is free, and has lots of languages available. Duolingo is a safe app."
it's so amazing to have the ability to learn new languages as if taking actual courses as you would in college or other manners in which you must pay. i love this app. I've began taking a second language & will continue with another. also getting family involved to surprise with trip to a place we can use our languages learned. so excited. thanks Duolingo
"Really good if you're looking to learn how to speak basic stuff in other languages, but for advanced learning I'd always still recommend you find an actual teacher who teaches in the language you look forward to learn. Overall interface really engaging, reminders help you keep a streak and practice a little daily and the reward system really makes you feel good about yourself if you manage to 100% ""Perfect"" a lesson. TL;DR: It's a fun app, good for learning basics but it doesn't replace teachers"
"This is a really good app to learn languages, but the problem I find is after accidently setting up an avatar, I am unable to remove it or put any photo from my galary in its place... PLEASE, It would be highly appreciated if you provide an option to change or remove the avatar. It is not only me who find this as a problem though, so please Duolingo, respond to our needs."
When you add the widget of the app to your home screen it gaslights you into believing that you did a lesson today. It just shows duo and the streak number but when I open the app and close it again then it shows the danger sign and asks to do a lesson. The widget was supposed to be a reminder for when you don't do a lesson instead it just ruined by new years resolution and I didn't do a lesson yesterday. Now I don't feel motivated to do it anymore.
"For no reason at all, it keeps persistingly skiping speaking and listening exercises. I also can't currently continue my super subscribtion so, there really isn't any way for me to practice those listening and speaking exercises in the practice hub. If there is someway it could be fixed, I would really be glad. I really liked duo and this is just frustrating!"
"It was the greatest app to learn, but about a month ago it started to buggy awfully. About to look for a new learning app. After last update it got even worse: no listening (click on the speaker but it doesn't work at all), and now I can see no pictures when it shows new words. Now it deserves only one star"
"The volume of the ads is jarringly louder than the actual lessons, which seems like a ploy to annoy one into buying the monetized version. If they would just turn the noise down this would be the perfect app for learning languages in a linguistically sound yet entertaining way. Highly recommended, just be ready to hit your mute when you finish a lesson. I'm definitely enjoying - and learning - from itüôèüèª‚úùÔ∏èüíñ"
I really like the format: shirt lessons which includes varied learning styles and the fun animations and reward system. This appdoesnt function the best as I have had to uninstall and reinstall 3 times. If it wasn't for that I would have given it 5 stars.
"Have been using this app for a couple of years now however, since the sentence discussions have been removed there is nowhere to get any explanation for things I don't understand. I fear I may have to give up Duolingo soon as I'm no longer understanding chunks of the lessons. It's a shame but I think it is a much poorer experience now hence downgrading from 5 stars to 3."
"Pros: - gamification: they nudge you to do your exercises daily. - baby steps: you can even learn a language with little daily investment. Helped me a lot in Italy Cons: - German they have a strange word order in sentences and only one option is accepted. - small things, such as ""auf Arbeit"" sound like they want you to use eastern German slang, which is so annoying and sounds horrible for the rest of Germany - English they expect you to guess the gender of people or singular/ plural"
"I like the apps content , not all, but it's quite good. What I don't like is the icon of the app, why is there an old droopy face of a bird on my screen I'm getting sick and tired of seeing it and I thinking about deleting I am over looking at that sad , depressed face on my phone."
"I love this app. It is helping me so much perfect my Spanish, and I can hop around to other languages. It keeps track of my progress and does reviews if I have been away for a while. It is also fun and motivating to get on every day to compete against others to level up. You can also follow others, be followed, and send and receive support."
"It is a very nice app and doesn't even have that much ads. it has really helped me learning Japanese, they also give tricks and tips while learning. Really a wonderful and great app!"
"I cannot recommend, it seems there is zero upkeep, nobody fixes bugs. They just keep inventing more gamification. When you get after the first few sections, the audio is broken and not playing (spanish and russian), the language specifics are not taken into account (polite and normal form in Spanish is impossible to guess from English and others). And what really broke the game is some lessons don't even load so you can't continue (Vikram's radio i.e.) in Spanish, Do not pay for this low quality"
"Duolingo is extremely useful in learning new languages. The best use case scenario would be to pair it up with something like ""Spanish to English"" dictionary. While Duolingo is not perfect and does not teach you everything, it is a very useful tool that you should give a try. You might just find yourself immersed in a new culture! Good luck with your learning!"
"I'm retracting my 5 stars. It's nothing about the app, but the widget. Ever since I updated duolingo, the widget has been running crazy. It always shows me the lighted streaks on the days that I haven't Done a lesson, while also showing me that I haven't done a lesson in some days I've done so.. This has cost me a lot of streaks, and have made me contemplate on removing the widget, pls fix it."
Japanese is still very limited compared to the Spanish skill tree. Only scratching the surface of A2 is annoying. I dont like the meme languages that are taking away from courses that could be further developed
I think it is very good app for true learners. If you want to learn any new language don't go to the other app come to the Duolingo. Thank you so much Duolingo! I'm so glad that I have a app like you. I'm taking lessons of learning Korean and giving my best. I hope I'll learn it.üòáüòáüíù
"Decreasing my rating again. Fewer and fewer tools, less and less of a teaching app and in recent months, I dunno, it seems to have become decidedly lackluster. The recent locking of the discussions has, IMO, decreased the value of this app. I used the discussions a lot to understand my mistakes especially with regard to grammar."
I have learned about as much Norwegian in one month as I have learned Spanish over the course of two semesters. The program is fun and it feels more like playing a game than it does studying. Highly recommend.
this is wonderful it has helped me learn the basics of korean vocabulary though I would recommend using other things along with it if you want to be fluent in the language you are taking. No person can learn everything from one thing. So I would recommend this as supplemental material or other ways of studying or if you want to be familiar with a language. I give it a 5/5 stars though. I highly recommend it.
"Duolingo's language learning programs are really well made and you can learn a lot, however it's overshadowed by the forced social experience which can inhibit real progress. XP means nothing, leagues are pointless and friend quests are a distraction from what you should be working on. The app should focus more on learning languages not comparing XP with strangers. HMU if you ever add an option to disable the social experience. Until then, adios Duo."
"It's a fun way to learn languages since you can think of it as a game! I think that you can give it to a child since it's not strict. if you get something wrong, then you lose a heart, but you get the chance to watch an ad to get one back at the end of the lesson. but I don't appreciate the ads since I'm learning new stuff but other than that, it is an awsome... learning system, or game"
"One thing I really don't like the competition who is on higher league, it's not about who is faster or not it's about the practice to learn something new im bit loosing the motivation to learn it,if you are not learning or not been using duolingo for two weeks 5he removing the achievements buges which is waist of time ,sometimes I can't be on duolingo because I'm busy or on my holiday. I think taking of achievement buges is unnecessarily I'm paying money for the membership."
"Really good at teaching different languages, but it's super pushy. The app wants me to practice literally every second of every day and the notifications get VERY annoying. A good thing I like about this is that every now and then, it gives you a few days of super for free."
"There is a system inside that motivates you through competition. You are given XP points by practicing, and XP points are compared between users. There is even a monthly championship for the best scores, that lasts for three whole weeks. I participated in a championship, spent a lot of time to get to a first place, and this has been one of the most disappointing experiences of my life. The winner gets laughable rewards and there is even not a notification in your friend's feeds about it."
"I have been using for personal use for years and find the lessons and challenges engaging if you are a motivated learner. I am now using to assist with a homeschool education for my kids and find all Duolingo apps extremely useful, fun, and educational. I am also aware that the public school system in our area is also using to assist with student learning so they must have also found value in it. Would personally recommend to anyone especially to help keep young learners engaged."
"Wonderful app to learn different languages, I enjoy the different ways of teaching and learning, reading in English, reading in an alternate language, matching in 2 languages and repeating sentences. I do believe it will benefit many ages as myself, husband and 8 year old all enjoy the app."
"great app, fun but i wish it would tell you the meaning of some words in the listening rounds - when you just select what you heard. if the meaning is not included - it's less useful."
"this game is very good, fantastic, elegant, outstanding, mind-blowing, so much words to define the game actually the game includes so many qualities we can do so many coarses and also the show us our mistakes if we are not able to hear they will show us 15 min. later so cool üòéüòé game and some technical issues with game sometimes they didn't show us the Hangul or leaderboard or exercises so this one otherwise the game is perfect I really enjoy it so much"
I think it is the perfect app to learn a language it challenges you so you keep on doing and also motivates you by giving gifts and rewards it is really worth downloading and because of repeating exercises you are unable to forget the words it also creates a good pronounciation unlike many apps with this app I am able to effortlessly learn French and i think soon I can learn another language too.
"I love this app because it has been helpful in my language learning journey but I'm rating it low because since the recent update, even when the network connection is good it keeps showing in your app that I'm offline. Same ""offline mode"" network is what I'll use to stream videos on YouTube and Netflix and there are no issues. You guys have to fix this up ASAP so you don't lose your reputation. This issue is killing the fun in this app!"
I've been using Duolingo for years now and it's great for learning languages casually. I have a 2 year Japanese streak and I feel that it has really prepped me for my trip to Japan. Recently they added a feature where you can scroll through and review all of the words you've learned which is great.
"Longer ads will make me to switch a new app. Today I had to watch two extremely long ads without the option to turning them off. If this will continue I will have to search for a new tool for learning. I've been using this app for 10 years I think. I am down with short ads, but these extreme long ones drive me fuzzylizzy to the delete app option. Update: 3/24/2024 the ads are getting even longer, I downgraded the app to 2 stars. More then 1 minute long ea"
teaches by example. uses excellent memorization techniques. I think it is a superb app for learning a language if used alongside other exposure to/learning about the language. it's really helpful when learning things that might not be obvious to those who learn by exposure alone.
The app is great. I loved discovering new languages and the grammar rules. It's ever-evolving and I see how creative it became now. It would be amazing though if you guys could add the opportunity to listen to your audios in the speaking exercises in order to compare it to the original one.
This is by far the best way to learn a new language. It's very fun and easy to use and I can already have conversations in another language. The content and courses ensure that you remain engaged and a little bit of friendly competition helps that. I will definitely recommend the app to anyone wanting to learn and I already do. Great work developers.
"It's a great application, but sometimes I was have bugs. It's very difficulty to study English if the app don't play sounds. I can't guessed what's mean the silence so I choose at random variants sometime. I rebooted my phone, I reconnected to another access point, but it all didn't help me. Can you fix your app? Please!"
"It's been a while since I've used Duo, but the progression system makes much more sense now, with 1 singular path (which is quite aesthetically pleasing, more like a game lobby map), and clear sections (which you can jump to with a test) for each path, indicating your proficiency in the language"
"It's alright to make some progress, although the voice recognition (at least in German) needs some work. The app even fails to recognise the voice of a native German speaker, when I asked him to try it for me. Then I dictated the same sentence(s) to Google translate + Android keyboard on my phone and both recognised everything."
"Duolingo makes learning a new language a piece of cake. it is very easy. it has a leadership board and day streaks to motivate you to study more without breaking routine. I actually give this a 4.5/5 because you can't suddenly understand what they're saying, so it will be hard to use Duolingo to travel to another country. I learnt Japanese and it was very fun‚ù§Ô∏èüéâü•∞ü§©"
"I love learning Greek with Duolingo!! The app makes learning a new language easy AND fun!! Each lesson feels like a game, and the leaderboard and friend features allow you compete against other users as well as celebrate their milestones, which motivates you to just keep going!! There's the occasional ad, but some are skippable, so it's not a big deal!! (A free app has to make revenue somehow, after all!!) Anyways, I recommend this app to any curious mind who loves language learning!!"
"The new update basically killed the kanji learning feature. It's just a vocabulary game, which is good if that's how it is advertised, but you can't learn Kanji through Duolingo anymore. Before, you actually wrote out Kanji in its stroke order and learned some words. Now, Kanji study is totally up to you independent of Duolingo. You could say that most people only want to read Japanese, not write it. But then the course introduces writing exercises that are impossible without selfstudy."
It is a very good application to learn any language. it's teaching techniques are very good any one can learn any language easily but I m facing some problem while doing lessons like it get exit from lesson and even from the app when I answered the question and press continue it dose not go to another question instead this it get close.. except this every thing is good üëç
"Duolingo is a fantastic language learning app that deserves a 5-star rating. It makes learning fun with its gamified approach, keeping you motivated with streaks and leaderboards. Plus, it's completely free and flexible, allowing you to learn at your own pace anytime, anywhere. As a beginner, you'll find it an excellent resource for building vocabulary and grasping basic grammar in a user-friendly way. In short this is the best language learning app"
"Korean lessons and in particular pronunciations sounds to written English answers is pretty bad. I had several native speakers listen to Duolingo saying ""ddu"" and Duolingo telling us the answer is supposed to be ""nu"". a few of the Korean pronunciations are poorly recorded. You have to turn volume to max to even hear anything at all. So maybe recordings are bad. Warning. Be prepared for your ears to bleed. By max volume, the ads will make you deaf. 2 stars as the app is easy to use."
"Really poor attention to regular and PREMIUM users for months. For instance, Duolingo has been mixing pasive and active voices in English exercises. Or making free translations when a direct one is possible (even better). The thing is: nobody is fixing it. They used to send a message accepting suggestions, so the community reporting mistakes had a feedback. Not anymore. Finally, Duolingo magnify regional differences between American and European English and Spanish."
"Duolingo is fine for vocab and basic sentences when you are first getting started learning a new language. However, the ""gamifacation"" of the lessons gets old after a while and you really need to supplement Duolingo with some other language material as your primary learning source and only use Duolingo as a secondary, easy, at-hand, refresher."
"I've used this app for a year, used the free version and loved it! I decided to subscribe and love it more! This is the only app I can say was not a waste of money or time. I honestly can't say or think anything bad about this app! This app rewards those who put in the effort without emptying your pocket. I surpassed 2 years worth of high school Spanish class in a month and that's with learning German at the same time with no prior knowledge. You get out of it what effort you put into it."
"I can only speak for the Spanish class. It's a great way to brush up, but the vocabulary is so limited (very child oriented) and the placement test can only go to a very low highest level, so if you're intermediate you'll be going back over a lot of beginner grammar before you can move on."
"I'm only 3 days in to my lessons, but wow! It's captivating and the way it's set up makes it so easy to remember. You review things a lot, you practice saying, seeing, typing, and hearing the words and phrases which really makes it stick in your brain. I'm really excited about how much fun I'm having with it."
"So I've been using Duoling for a month now, I just over to an area with a bigger Spanish speaking population than where I grew up. I work at a hotel, and I had a Spanish speaking man come in with no reservation. We were both nervous and stumbling and then Spanish just fell out of my mouth. One of the first lessons for Spanish is exploring a city and getting around and travel, and the words just came out and really helped. We were both shocked and so happy. You Must put in the work."
"Pushes their super subscription every time you make a mistake, you will make lots of mistakes and every time you run out of hearts you have to do an annoying and repetitive exercise for 2 hearts, and that is if you watch an add after. Once again, trying to get you to give them money while taking away from the learning possibilities."
"Learning a language changes your perception of the world. learning a language isn't just about learning words, it's the culture that comes with it. Most language learning platforms forget that, but not Duolingo. A few minutes a day for some time, and you'll be able to make simple conversation. Nice job, Duolingo!"
"extremely difficult to evolve, way too many phrases you'll never have to use irl, way too many weeks with no new words, no explinations for the mistakes, they help you make mistakes by arranging words that look alike next to each other, moronic and annoying untargeted ads, tons of notifications, always asking for money even though the paid version is just as lame as the unpaid, no difference between them, so no way to evolve in a faster pace or at least to learn new words, not so usefull app"
"I loved the app at first, but the more I use it, the worse it gets. At the start, I was learning lots of new words and phrases. Now, I get like 1-2 new words a week, the rest of the time just repetition. On top of that, it completely messed which words I've learned - some words I've already seen, and I get them as ""new word"". Others I've never seen, but it just assumes I know them. It feels more like a waste of time now, rather than a language learning."
"This app is good. Why i am rating it with one star is that, someone can't use the app without connecting to WiFi. I want to connect with mobile data but, no i can't do that because it is not WiFi. Please, the developers should take note of it. It very annoying because i have gone far in the lesson."
this helps you talk to people in different languages! If you want to learn Spanish or French duolingo is your saver it helped me talk to a friend of mine! this really is a amazing app but you can join super duolingo which is super helpful
"Honestly I'm only on my second day, but with me actually focusing and wanting to learn, with the words I've been given I'm able to remember and say out a sentence, then I constantly repeat what I've been taught that day aswell as continuing to form the simple sentences, I'm on the letters at the moment and its helping to write them down as well a a word that has the sound the letter makes, and its helping a lot, first time trying to learn a new language and with the format this app has, it helps"
"It's not really what I need in that it doesn't tell me the rules so I can understand, but works on relying on me memorising words rather than understanding their uses. I would like to be able to personalise the lessons and not be in constant competition mode which doesn't motivate me. I am unable to send them any feedback so using this avenue."
"it's actually a good and friendly language app for those who are just starting, but l'm giving such advice that only Duolingo is not worth it, you must need help with online platforms and have to take online coaching classes or something else, but ultimately this is really a recommended app for beginners. otherwise, If you're concerned about advertisements, this app has minimal distractions."
Would not recommend getting Super Duolingo. When I signed up for Super I agreed to a monthly billing cycle that I could cancle at any time. I supposed since then the terms changed to only an annual subscription and I was charged $92 dollars at once for 12 months that I did not sign up for. Great app but wouldn't invest in it again.
"I think this is a very user friendly app, amazingly almost impossible to advance without your brain. Highly recommend it. There IS a premium subscription if you so desire, but you're fine without it, not pay to advance, and Duolingo without premium I think helps you to think about it and not make mistakes."
"I was able to learn different languages with just clicked off my phone, me, and my daughter, and I know how to speak French now. But the reason why I gave it for stars is because you only get a little bit of hearts, and if you need to finish the lesson later you can because it resets the lesson, but either way I love this app."
"it doesn't feel like work, fairly simple, but I'm surprised how quickly in learning. there's pretty sophisticated brain/learning science behind these fun cartoon characters."
"Every time you feel like you're getting somewhere they release an update that completely reshuffles all your lessons and changes definitions. So things you never learned it thinks you did and things you have it thinks you didn't, its a mess. All while bringing more and more bugs that didn't previously exist with each update. It used to be amazing a year ago but I guess corporate greed took over since."
"Great app for learning the basics! Just wished that along with showing what word goes in which grammar position of a sentence, it also showed / taught you WHY it went there in that situation, so you understood why that word or word derivative was used instead of just relying upon rote learning. Overall, though, solid 8 / 10!"
"Frankly, I like it better than Babbel. It's more thorough and even easier to truly learn at the same time. I love that it really ""drills"" you over and over in reading, matching words, speaking, hearing the words, etc. Very comprehensive learning. I like it!"
"Duolingo is a great app for children and adults who want to learn a new language! I have learned alot from Duolingo, i have learned French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish! It might be hard to keep that long streak up, but Duolingo is fun, so you wont miss one day! They also help you learn more of the language if you already know some words. Long story short, Duolingo is a great app to learn languages for all ages!"
"I have enjoyed Duo and it has helped me improve my language skills. However, the app, for whatever reason has some bugs that take away earned gems or hearts unnecessarily. I have found this frustrating on many occasions. App also freezes in the middle of a lesson."
"This is good for language learning, but there are some problems here. Like, if I write he, it looks wrong and they say, she It always say the opposite of what I write, and sometimes my points don't add up, and everything else is fine."
"The application is fine, but Support and Accessibility features are severely lacking. I contacted Support through email numerous times over the past months after encountering issues with their Accessibility Features not changing anything in lessons. No response. I will be paying for another application that takes disabilities seriously and so should you."
"This app is nice for beginner learners. But, I am not a beginner. I am using this app since january and this app has the potential to change the grammar mistakes, unknown meanings, the language, etc., of a person. But, i have given 4 ratings because of the following reasons: (i) Repetition of sentences (ii) Bring more story concept, assign new words."
"Duolingo is great for learning the language. The only complaint I have is that there is no way to temporarily opt out of the competition side without losing ground. And since there are better ways to earn points that doing lessons it leads to problems, especially when you have vacation or a busy week at work."
"Love this app! They have added a section where you can review the words that you've learned which I was hopeing they would add and they did, and so easy and fun to practice every day. Been working with this app for over a year now and I am amazed by how much I've learned where spanish class back in high school I had a hard time following it."
"It helps me a lot learning new stuff, but sometimes it makes me want to delete it with how I miss a spelling by 1 letter. It's super good to use, though, as I'm on my 115-day streak. Duolingo is great to use, but be careful when using it since if you're in harder lessons, then the harder it will be. I literally missed one letter typing, and it made me lose more hearts than ever. And the fact we need to learn more lessons to get hearts is nice, but it takes more time to do that. Very helpful tho."
"Is it just me or is there a problem with the sync/progress saving? Recently Duo doesn't automatically update my progress after I finish a lesson. The only workaround for me is to close Duo and reopen :-( Other than that, great app. On my way to 1 year streak :-) Update: the progress sync is working again. Thanks, guys! üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª"
this app is brilliant and it is not like a study but a game and the little green bird is like a friend. we can learn new language very easily in just few minutes. no adds is also a good thing
"its not laggy, ui is great, ads r not tht annoying Update.... After a while of using it, at least for korean i find that its useful to learn letters, but isnt that useful in anything else, for example there is no explanation why ""key"" In korean is sometimes ""key"" And some orher times ""yolse"". You just gotta memorize it, and thats not a good way of learning"
"For a free app that helps you learn foreign languages, this is pretty good. It helps you learn by making games. Some of the content is a little obscure and not practical (learning the word for ""cat"" before ""I am going""), but the lessons are manageable and help a person become familiar with a foreign language."
"Good app. However, there are many occasions where the distinction between casual YOU and formal or plural YOU in the exercises are not clear. Answers to either should be accepted as long as either answer is correctly translated."
"it's very good for beginners, but lacks specificity for more advanced learning. the biggest drawback is the difficulty in communicating with Duolingo. odd seeing as it is an app about communication. also it uses American English, not UK English, so often is incorrect."
So I've enjoy learning the language using Duolingo however I do find it gets repetitive also I would challenge Duolingo to record them doing the word challenges in the time allocated for that alone I'm going to knock off two stars as it's actually not possible to complete the word challenges in the time allocated without buying time extensions and I'm pretty fast at matching. This is a monetizing strategy to lure people to ascend to the upper tiers.
"Normally I have a good time with the app, even had a streak of over 800 days! But just today at exactly 12:00 I had finished a lesson and it used one of my freezes. However instead of protecting my streak, it broke my streak, putting me all the way back on day 1. What's the point of the freezes if they don't keep your streak? I'm so ticked off. It didn't even offer to repair the steak via gems or with super duolingo like it had before idk I'm just peeved."
I wish we added the ability to repeat incorrect tasks within the class session itself. Give the student the possibility of practicing pronunciations as if it were in a dictionary. Very good app and the best I've found so far. I recommend it to everyone.
"I love duolingo it has really helped me with school work and just learning the languages. Sometimes, it gets annoying when the premium thing comes up. But otherwise, it's amazing. It's very helpful being able to have an account on different devices, in my case, I have it on my phone and on my laptop. Anyway, I really do recommend duolingo. Also if you get it, have fun!"
"Amazing app. How Duolingo makes learning fun by gamification (and actually fun, not a weak attempt at trying to make learning fun) is matched by no other. They offer a great free experience, with their premium package being fairly priced, and not blocking necessary functions which makes the free version unusable. Love it. Keep it going, Duolingo. Amazing marketing and community building, too. Honestly, huge fan."
I hate the path version. I hate it so much. If you're not gonna change it back can you at least give us an option to do the same exercises over and over instead of spaced repetition? It doesn't work for me and I don't feel I'm learning or retaining any new information. PLEASE
"I love this app, it will literally learn you a language in a fast way, it also has examples and they are perfect! But there will be a LOT of PROBLEMS! 1-Im an android user and we dont have courses like music or math, the app will be not much fun so please fix it 2-I sometimes dont know if Im closer to any achievement like perfect lessons, etc. But iPhone HAS it?! Why iPhone is getting so much attention?(not hating) 3-the lip syncing is working for them but not for androids?! Please fix it"
"Im learning japanese just for fun and it works decently. Translate this sentence are annoying when 1. you have to tap each word, get them in the wrong order, can't move them. Very annoying when doing timed stuff. 2. The learning language is spoken while translating fom eng is not, making it kind of frustrating when you're slow processing writing... 3. Words repeating for so long... Sometimes being a weird pick of them, like I have no reason to repeat the world lawyer 700 times."
"this is a great app for learning any language,there are listening,speaking and spelling exercises that help a lot although without the premium features it is a bit annoying with the ads and limited hearts but u can get hearts by practicing so that's good and also idk if the lag is my phones problem or the apps also there should be and option to ask any doubts because I was confused about something and I had to google it so it will be appreciated if we could ask questions.9/10 would recommend"
"March 18th, 2024. What just happened with this update?!?! I was learning Chinese, now there is a total mess. Sections have changed units, yet supposedly I have them up to gold, there is so much new characters in those ""mastered"" parts that I don't even know what to do (except that I know I have to reset all my progress till now and star again)... After the update even lessons stopped working properly, there is no progress on them."
"This is a great app it works perfectly fine for me,and it keeps me motivated as well I've been using it for 2 weeks now and i can tell I've learned a lot from the past lessons i did in Duolingo."
Good app with a lot of ads and it's free. It certainly can help you learn a new language. I upgraded to paid account to have unlimited lives to play. The learning pace is faster.
I am learning my new language so quickly. I'm learning Spanish as a necessity to communicate with my new Love and he noticed too. It's well worth trying. I also cannot afford to do any upgrading and it's perfectly fine for free. You can do practice sessions and hone in on things you've already learned to earn hearts back to continue on. There's not one thing that I can think of that I don't like about this app. It's amazing!
"enjoying learning and practicing korean through the app. it allows yolu to review past lessons and it constantly repeats words, letters and phrases to make sure it sticks to you, and this is exactly what i need. 5‚≠ês üòä"
This app really sucks from the version a few years ago. The ads are Ultra intrusive and it feels like a Candy Crush Style game for Facebook moms with the hearts system It has very scummy business practices like forcing you to get Hearts if you want to continue a lesson and telling you the whole lesson will be lost unless you purchase some hearts right now to keep playing. It will intentionally give you vocabulary for a language you don't speak and it hasn't taught you to force loss of hearts
"bugs are getting better, but seems like theres an emphasis on spelling out specific locations (such as castles) I'll probably never see as im living in another country. Language learning should not be limited to spelling local (or specific) locations unless its an advanced class. still haven't even touched on past/future tense here yet."
"Duolingo is great if you just need a gamified way to remind you to do some learning everyday eg when learning Japanese characters or your first words, but the explanations are not very good and the exercises doesn't teach very well, eg ""of course"" gets translated to ""that's obvious"" so you have no idea what those words mean in other contexts. Finally they regularly change around course content which messes up progress so it thinks I know words I've never seen before."
"It is not so bad, but then it is at the same time. The first and only good thing about the app is that there aren't as many ads. Why do you need hearts to learn? Why not just be able to learn for free and not have to buy super, which is already costly. Also, can you make it so that streak freezes are fewer gems My biggest regrets Linc L"
"I love this app, I would give it a 5 star if it hadn't been for this bug. I was taking a Spanish lesson and there was a voice message thing you had to speak the sentence they gave but when I said the right stuff, it was loading so long I sat there for 5 mins then I had no choice but to quit, Duolingo please fix this"
"it's a very good app for people to learn a language.... all the alphabets....and how to read..... right now I am beginer although I can't understand the meaning of korean words...iam able to read all the words, letters..and sentences half fluently.... Iam giving 4 stars.... and I can rate it to a 5 star in the future....if Duolingo continuosly provide good guidance to me in learning. But they show one add after each lesson...and that's a bit annoying. It makes me fell like stop using the app.."
"Don't know what's going on at the moment. Have been using Duolingo for over 4 years with no problems. But this last week since updating, it syncs everytime I go onto it and takes me back 5/10 lessons. The lesson I am currently doing I've completed at least 6 times. Getting really fed up now. Any suggestions please."
I really enjoy duolingo and have learned so much off of it so thankyou. One thing though and that's that the pace. It has a normal track and if your a slow learner you can review but there isn't any option for learning it faster because sometimes I get bored of having to do the same thing so much.
"I like the way it's currently set up so instead of doing the same basic lessons super fast to earn xp, you are kinda force to continue advancing your language learning. They've gone in and made it easier to keep your streak and seem to have made most timer boosts no longer start automatically when you log in/receive the boost reward."
"It's fine, but it glitches a lot. Like every few word bank lessons it will only let me select two of the six or seven words necessary to complete the prompt. And I either have to choose to submit my answer with said error and lose a heart, or quit and lose all my progress on that lesson. Very annoying, especially since I've reported the issue a few times already."
"Good system, really repetitive if you need it to be to practice the difficult bits. you have to work out the complexity of the grammar yourself though and a word search function would be really useful. a great way to start and get the basics but you do need to find a native speaker."
"Been learning french for 200 days and I can still confidently say I still don't understand one sentence a french person would casually say without translation. The app doesn't encourage you to write, understand different sentences and talk by yourself but rather keeps teaching you new vocabulary and makes you translate sentences. Duolingo is good to teach the basics of a language such as simple grammar, new vocabulary and new letters. But not good to learn to speak an entire language"
"Duolingo makes it really fun and rewarding to learn a new language. The progression of the course feels very natural and well thought out. I purchased the family plan and while I love not having ads or limits, i feel that the value added is not really worth the $167 I paid for the year."
It's good no lie but I quickly found myself struggling to keep in a league instead of enjoying learning. After a while I forgot about it since I couldn't learn at my own pace. Not everyone has time everyday. Give us the option to opt out of a league. Obviously the league will have great rewards or whatever but give us an option atleast
"I was using this app before the update and I'm very pleasantly surprised that after coming back to it, they added a new feature that allows you to regain the hearts you've lost by doing lessons. Now I can focus on the practicing part instead of the mistakes I've made part! Five out of five ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"The app used to give a lot of support in helping you through trouble areas e.g there was a forum where you could ask questions about a specific problem or when the app noticed a spot you were struggling with it would give you tips. These both seem to be gone now so it's more difficult to learn and progress using just the app, now I need other resources."
I think they should have left the answer planation part that was done by humans for the free tier. I feel human explanations are sometimes easier to understand. when not subscribed they should just add AI explanations. I noticed when I did the free trial and tried to do more exercises they started repeating the exercises as if to say since it's free we won't give you full paid access just my thoughts. They took features away that made sense in order to get you to pay understandably it's business
"It's a pretty nice and a easy learning app for me. I try to learn as much as I can with the help of Duolingo . I Don't get bored at all . By the help of Duolingo, I can learn Japanese way faster than before ."
"I really like duolingo, especially since they kind of changed how the app operates. The units are more organized and sectioned and out of all the new things they have. The widgets are my favorite part everyday. I only wish they had new pictures for the widgets. I like to strive and see new funny duolingo pictures everyday."
I have lived in Germany for two years now and Duolingo has really helped me improve my German a lot! Supplementing my German language course with this app has made it easy for me to apply what I learn in class. And through repetition in turn makes me more confident in real world situations where I used to be reluctant to do so.
"A fun way to learn a new language. Sometimes I find myself being too competitive and move ahead before I have truly grasped the lesson. When that happens I force myself to ignore points or leagues and focus on mastering the level. I enjoy the new ""Words"" list for practice and reminders."
"I like the notifications and incentives it provides for you to reach your goal. My issue is when I complete a lesson, I always have to exit and clear it from my history and reopen the app for it to update that I've completed a level and go to the next lesson. It's great that I can learn more than one language at a time on here as well! A drawback is that it doesn't always provide the English translations for Korean. So, I'm learning Korean words. However, I don't know what they mean in English."
"Good app with many useful features. Main complaint is that your learned vocab is not available on Android and it is on iPhone. This is DISCRIMINATION. Just reduced my rating as they have changed my icon to sad ugly face. I suspect this is a cheap trick to get attention. Well, you sad manipulators, that's gonna backfire on you."
"The best App to learn a language üî• Simple short lessons in a game format is all you need to establish a habit. Even if you're not motivated, you actually want to come back and learn at least a 5 min lesson (thanks to streaks). I use the App while commuting and time flies. The only request I have: please, add Urdu language üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª P.S. Also I'm looking forward to Math and Music courses to be available for Android users."
"Stupid app!! Purchased the family pack for my kids but I can't add them without creating a new email or FB profile for each! So annoying! Even when creating a new Duolingo profile for each of them and I add my email as a parent, it doesn't recognize me as the parent and doesn't add them to my subscription automatically! Sent 3 emails over the past 3 weeks and didn't receive any reply! Look elsewhere!"
Once again I spent over an hour studying on Duolingo and got no credit for the time spent. I am now going to get either a streak freeze or lose my consecutive days. I've already lost many. Personalized practice is a complete waste of time. I rarely miss a single one and I would rather spend my time learning something I don't already know. I've been boycotting Duolingo.
"Great app, I want to learn Norwegian and Duolingo is perfect! It's fun, and I really like it. But there is a problem. Sometimes, when i'm playing the games where you have to put the correct words in order, it just won't let me put the right answer, and I lose hearts. Please fix this."
"I used to enjoy Duolingo. Recent changes have made it more difficult to use by removing any options to report issues or find out where and why I am going wrong. Now it keeps synching to a new course every few days, wiping out all my recent progress and forcing me to repeat the same unit over and over again for no reason. I am unlikely to renew my subscription I assume it is some kind of bug, but if this carries on I will not renew my subscription."
"I really like this app, it helps a lot in learning another language. But one of the things I hate about it are the ads. Every lesson I do, there is an ad! Though after a few seconds, they'll give you the option to close. Despite that, some of the ads will not exit, even when they give you the button to exit. You'll click and click until they are done with that ad or they have delayed, and my phone is brand new! Please, fix it. It is so annoying!"
"It's not adding the XP even after completing many lessons and challenges, today. Spent an hour and completed challenges on 2x XP, But the XPs are just disappearing in thin air. I restarted the app several times. Even worse..after restarting the app, my existing XP has reduced less than half. So frustrating."
"Beyond defeated and frustrated. Unless you pass the exercise ALL EFFORT DOESNT COUNT. I'm sorry I've taken a hit with the economy and I can't afford a membership but to kick me in the groin for even trying and I'm sorry, conjugation of verbs is hard in a language not your own when you're learning, only to have it fail you when you try your damndest to practice every day... Congratulations. You've killed my desire to learn. Thank you so very much for that."
"Well made app for those who wants to learn the basics of a new language. I agree with what most people say, it's shouldn't be the only avenue for learning a new language since it's gamified so much that it's still beneficial to have a formal classes instead. However, in my case, Japanese, there's an option to turn off romanized pronunciation so it's a good challenge. Hope that this app will improve more in the future though."
I enjoy learning a new language with duolingo because the lessons are fun and easy to follow. I spend time on here because it makes learning into a game by allowing us to compete against others to get awards for learning.
"Paid for a year subscription but then my phone died. After installing the app on my new phone I was unable to login to my account. After attempting to reset the password many times I reciece the error that my email/account name is invalid & contacting support online multiple times I've received no assistance with account retrieval. The account recovery messages say a solution is coming but not to expect anything right away, for weeks. I can't recommend paying for an app with no support."
I am very happy that I got this app. If you are looking to learn a language perfectly this app is not for you. If you want to learn the basics of a language enough to speak it generally this is the place to do that. i have read many complaints and I have seen that many of them were addressed. one complaint I have is that for the multiple choice things where you choose words to translate they capitalize the word that comes first accidentally offering a hint.
"Duolingo is a very good app for learning new languages or advancing your native language it helps you to write what you learn even, but i find some difficulties while making the timed challenges because i need few sec searching for the word and that wastes alots of secs that can be useful later. plus it will be great if duolingo adds voice talking option so be more advanced app. finally in my opinion Doulingo is amazing app for everyvone who wants to kearn new language or advance their own lang"
"Duolingo has become too gamified, which undermines proper language learning, and it frustratingly doesn't have useful travellers lessons so that if you are travelling to a country, whose language you don't have, you can't use Duolingo to quickly get some basic communication tips. I think this is a major fail. Travel is often the entry point to a language and it is odd that greetings, asking for directions, ordering food and drink, etc, is many levels in."
i legit can't find anything really wrong with duolingo. the only exceptions are that some characters are glitched/look worse than on computer but that doesn't change how great this app is
"Probably the best free app for learning a new language out there. While there are definitely incentives to pay for the premium version, the free version is still very usable, with only minimal compromises to push you towards the premium subscription. Would definitely recommend."
"I decided to come back to practice, because why not, and it's making me ""re-learn"" ÌïúÍ∏Ä! Í∑∏Î¶¨Í≥† ÏÜåÎ¶¨Í∞Ä ÌãÄÎ†∏ÏäµÎãàÎã§. So why would I want to start from the WRONG beginning again? This is a massive design flaw. FAIL FAIL FAIL. I am so glad my friends agree this app is not worth their time. Also there's a great video of a guy correcting the grammar this app uses for lessons."
I really liked this app back in 2023 . Then I re-downloaded it and realised what a mistake I would have made if I rated it that time . I absolutely HATE the super duolingo okay . This version was newly introduced in 2023 and it wasn't as bad as it is now. Duolingo has so many ads like there was hardly any in 2023 . They don't even let me do the ramp up challenge. It was free back then .I know longer call duolingo a free app. Please don't download duolingo anymore .Miss old duo .Bring it back !!!
"Terrible report system. I have reported multiple times a grammatically wrong English translations, even terrible audios, and recorded audios aren't picking up well, at the end of the lesson, they still want you to answer THEIR OWN CORRECT ANSWER! Really really terrible!!!!!!!!!"
"Some language courses need to be worked on (Haitian Creole). There is a clear difference between some of the language courses. Lessons are repetitive and at times confusing. For example, Haitian creole had around 5-6 different words for ""the"" and are all used differently. I would have never gotten pass unit 3 if I hadn't looked this information up because duo simply gives you the definition and not how it's used. Deff needs work >_>"
"The way Duolingo teaches language, it really sticks with you and works. I've tried many other methods in the past only learning the way a child learns their native language, insignificant bits and pieces you hope to eventually be able to put together. Duolingo teaches in a way you really learn. After a small effort I can have basic conversation with native speakers and within the group that is learning with me. I am very happy with Duolingo, look forward to mastering this language, and another."
"I am struggling with understanding certain concepts due to the lack of clarity. No explanation provided. For example, the concept of are you/do you in Turkish takes more than one word. The app failed to clarify which one for which case. That's why I got stuck on a certain level. I can't pass it because every time I do mistakes, I don't know why it is like that. So I can't avoid the same mistakes later. This is absurd."
"Duolingo is great for learning a language iteratively. I recommend trying it and seeing if it is for you. However, the app can be SO annoying. It seems to be engineered this way, you'll find the annoying bits soon enough. I also heard they were scrapping a number of employees to make way for AI. That is probably not going to go well long term. It has asked me for around 500 days to rate it. I really didn't want to. So here we are: an average rating, non-specific feedback and conjecture."
My only complaint is they constantly make big changes to the app and how the lessons are presented. The newest change is the worst. I don't see how to go back to the tracks for previous units.
"Some languages are absolutely horrendous to learn, mainly because they don't explain WHY something is phrased a certain way. Not to mention the Navajo language sounds like it was recorded in a basement. Czech doesn't even have voiced lines which, to me, is mind boggling. They found a person to voice the Navajo language and not Czech? Which is easily 3x more common? Plus the leagues are definitely rigged, if you have super, you get top 3. If you dont, good luck."
Great fun and easy to learn. But if you do not subscribe you now get an advertisement of 5 seconds after every lesson which is so distracting and uses up ones data. And the sound is so loud. I need to switch off advertisement sound at the start. Please reconsider shorter advertisements of 3 seconds or less for those of us who cannot afford your subscription.
"Fun to play, I guess that's the point. But as a lifelong multilingual person, I'm finding it rather superficial and potentially harmful to my language learning so I'm taking it with a grain of salt... Warning: I downloaded it to help with Spanish (Spain setting), which I've been speaking for years with family in Spain. The vocabulary - verbs and nouns - are frequently different in Duolingo. My family speaks standard castellano and lives in a big city. This is unfortunately useless."
"I don't know if your supposed to be able to already speak a little bit of what your learning in 134 days but I still can't speak small sentences. I know some of the words and what they mean but others are too hard to remember what they mean or what the words are. Anyways, using Duo is really fun!!"
"Duolingo (In the German course) is great. My only problem I with it is the fact that Bea (One of the characters) talks way to fast. I can understand all of the other characters perfectly fine except Bea. I have repeat her sentences far more than I do anyone else. Another problem I have is some of the dumb sentences you have to translate. I get adding funny sentences to make learning enjoyable but most of the ""funny"" sentences aren't funny. The sentences need an update."
"Love the platform, and I'm definitely learning a language, albeit slowly. I only wish it included more information about and instruction of the grammer. I would give 5 stars for sure if it did, but in the present version, I have to supplement with other sources and/or Google search to read more about and truly understand the grammer rules."
"It is a very good learning material, but when I chose my avatar it wouldn't let me change it back to the image I had before which was a real let down because I had duolingo plus on the account and now I'm stuck with the ugly avatar and won't let me change back. This app also has very little grammatical rules to teach you, it doesn't fully tell you how to do it."
"I like this app, I have learned a lot of German words since I downloaded it. I hope the creators read this review because I'm sure a lot of other subscribers have this same issue. Here is my issue: while practicing speaking, I have intentionally missed pronounced words or have used totally different words to see if tell me I'm wrong. Well guess what, I still to get it right. If it doesn't tell me I'm wrong then I will learn to speak wrong. Please fix this issue thx"
"Subscribed to super duo after a free trial. When I thought I selected a monthly subscription so I could have the service for a few months, I was charged for a yearly subscription without a way to be refunded. Very deceptive."
"2024-04-08: Removed another star cause you increased the cost to play match madness from 30 to 100 gems, I'm so close to uninstalling. OG: Dislike the new map-like layout. The ""Level Up"" bubble blocks the previous lesson, making reviewing certain lessons impossible. The previous layout was much better, splitting things into categories."
it is easy to use and u get the hand of it quickly. It needs improvement on the levels it teaches thing we already know over and over again. but most of all good
"Duo used to be better. I use it for Japanese. They did away with the helpful comment section. There is no duo community now. I can't even select the sentences I get wrong to copy and paste into other programs to even understand the sentence. The hints dont help, and no comment section to help either. You need to choose an avatar now too. It's free but it just seems like it's getting worse. I even lost an 800+ day streak bc I was unmotivated and chose to learn in other ways. I want off this ride"
"This is making me learn Russian so much easier! it's been hard for me to learn Russian by my parents, But now using duolingo, It's so much easier. But there's just one thing, there's no Latvian option to learn. but over all, 5/5. I recommend you use this app although it doesn't have much languages to learn, Still use it! It makes learning languages much much easier to learn new languages. I recommend adding more languages to this app so people can learn more! Thank you for reading! (if you did.)"
"A fun and engaging app but best used as a supplement to formal language learning. You won't become fluent or even be able to speak well using Duolingo alone. However it is excellent for vocab aquisition, repetition, and practice which are essential to learning a language. Plus its super fun and addicting too!"
"Russian / Polish. Fun & easy, if you make sure you go in with some knowledge of the language first as there's no real TEACHING going on, more like flashcards for reminders which is no good if you happen to be a total beginner. No explanation of the seven cases, which is crucial when understanding Slavic languages. More of a game than a serious language app as it is not instructional enough. Also, I noted there are very silly sentences to learn that are useless IRL."
"Can't believe I waited so long to try it out! Gives me the same feeling as mobile games, except I'm actually learning useful information! So far the learning structure and lessons seem to be done well, with a mix of selecting, typing and speaking responses. Great app!"
"I'm so tired of the app crashing several times per lesson, random restarts, randomly turning off speech exercises because it's taking too long to start recording. It's exhausting to try to get even one lesson done let alone complete all my daily goals and I don't want to give up my learning but I'm so close to giving up on this app."
I think I have learnt my lesson: if an app works just fine DON'T UPDATE IT. it has been hell since the update. The app became slow in load Duolingo has been a very helpful app but recently it has been filled up with a lot of bugs causing a lot of lags between each sessions. I observed this started with the recent update.
"nice app for learning, but hangs & crashes often in my mobile device due to which I've lost 150 gems so far. also when playing timed challenges clicking on check & continue makes it slow and there is also a really annoying pause after hitting the continue button which results in multiple wasted seconds, making me loose & start from the beginning. Also it lacks some basic day to day conversation like 'how are you?' etc."
"I was really enjoying the app with my 11-year-old. Then, something happened after an update, which interrupted our progress together. My lessons look completely different from hers, and now she's discouraged from learning because it was enjoyable doing it together. I would like to know how to undo this if I somehow activated it by accident."
"Ive been reporting a bug from past 3 weeks. The app wont allow me to do ny speaking exercises and as soon as i clik on record it glitches and says ""slrry try again"" untile eventually i have to skip all my speaking problems and this is resulting in me loosing all my hearts and thus again being unable to finish my exercise. Its annoying. I cant go on with my lessons. Ive sent an email with screenshots and screen recording can you please fix it asap? Im loosing all my motivation."
"Was progressing really well until I got to the section learning numbers, specifically any speaking exercises. It just won't recognize the words for any numbers, but recognizes all other words in a phrase, causing me to get many attempts ""wrong"". Doubt I'll be renewing my subscription if this isn't fixed."
